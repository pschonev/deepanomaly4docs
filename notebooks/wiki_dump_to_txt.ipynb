       "'<doc id=\"12\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12\" title=\"Anarchism\">\\nAnarchism\\n\\nAnarchism is a political philosophy and movement that rejects all involuntary, coercive forms of hierarchy. It calls for the abolition of the state which it holds to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful.\\n\\nThe history of anarchism goes back to prehistory, when some humans lived in anarchistic societies long before the establishment of formal states, realms or empires. With the rise of organised hierarchical bodies, skepticism toward authority also rose, but it was not until the 19th century that a self-conscious political movement emerged. During the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers\\' struggles for emancipation. Various anarchist schools of thought formed during this period. Anarchists have taken part in several revolutions, most notably in the Spanish Civil War, whose end marked the end of anarchism\\'s classical era. In the last decades of the 20th century and into the 21st century, the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more.\\n\\nAnarchism employs various tactics in order to meet its ideal ends; these can be broadly separated into revolutionary and evolutionary tactics. There is significant overlap between the two which are merely descriptive. Revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state, and have taken a violent turn in the past. Evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like. Anarchist thought, criticism and praxis have played a part in diverse areas of human society. Criticism of anarchism mainly focuses on claims of it being internally inconsistent, violent and utopian.\\n\\nThe etymological origin of \"anarchism\" is from the Ancient Greek \"anarkhia\", meaning \"without a ruler\", composed of the prefix \"an-\" (i.e. \"without\") and the word \"arkhos\" (i.e. \"leader\" or \"ruler\"). The suffix \"-ism\" denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy. \"Anarchism\" appears in English from 1642 as \"anarchisme\" and \"anarchy\" from 1539. Various factions within the French Revolution labelled their opponents as \"anarchists\", although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists. Many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as William Godwin (1756–1836) and Wilhelm Weitling (1808–1871) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, but they did not use \"anarchist\" or \"anarchism\" in describing themselves or their beliefs.\\n\\nThe first political philosopher to call himself an \"anarchist\" () was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–1865), marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-19th century. Since the 1890s and beginning in France, \"libertarianism\" has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States. On the other hand, some use \"libertarianism\" to refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only, referring to free-market anarchism as \"libertarian anarchism\".\\n\\nWhile opposition to the state is central to anarchist thought, defining anarchism is not an easy task as there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently. Hence, it might be true to say that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing authority and hierarchical organization (including the state, capitalism, nationalism and all associated institutions) in the conduct of all human relations in favour of a society based on voluntary association, on freedom and on decentralisation, but this definition has the same shortcomings as the definition based on etymology (which is simply a negation of a ruler), or based on anti-statism (anarchism is much more than that) or even the anti-authoritarian (which is an \"a posteriori\" conclusion). Nonetheless, major elements of the definition of anarchism include the following:\\n\\nDuring the prehistoric era of mankind, an established authority did not exist. It was after the creation of towns and cities that institutions of authority were established and anarchistic ideas espoused as a reaction. Most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in China and Greece. In China, philosophical anarchism (i.e. the discussion on the legitimacy of the state) was delineated by Taoist philosophers Zhuang Zhou and Laozi.\\n\\nLikewise, anarchic attitudes were articulated by tragedians and philosophers in Greece. Aeschylus and Sophocles used the myth of Antigone to illustrate the conflict between rules set by the state and personal autonomy. Socrates questioned Athenian authorities constantly and insisted to the right of individual freedom of consciousness. Cynics dismissed human law (\"nomos\") and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature (\"physis\"). Stoics were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state.\\n\\nDuring the Middle Ages, there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements in the Muslim world or in Christian Europe. This kind of tradition later gave birth to religious anarchism. In the Sasanian Empire, Mazdak called for an egalitarian society and the abolition of monarchy, only to be soon executed by Emperor Kavad I.\\n\\nIn Basra, religious sects preached against the state. In Europe, various sects developed anti-state and libertarian tendencies. Libertarian ideas further emerged during the Renaissance with the spread of reasoning and humanism through Europe. Novelists fictionalised ideal societies that were based not on coercion but voluntarism. The Enlightenment further pushed towards anarchism with the optimism for social progress.\\n\\nDuring the French Revolution, partisan groups such as the Enragés and the saw a turning point in the fermentation of anti-state and federalist sentiments. The first anarchist currents developed throughout the 18th century—William Godwin espoused philosophical anarchism in England, morally delegitimizing the state, Max Stirner\\'s thinking paved the way to individualism, and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon\\'s theory of mutualism found fertile soil in France. This era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the Spanish Civil War of 1936 and is considered the golden age of anarchism.\\nDrawing from mutualism, Mikhail Bakunin founded collectivist anarchism and entered the International Workingmen\\'s Association, a class worker union later known as the First International that formed in 1864 to unite diverse revolutionary currents. The International became a significant political force, with Karl Marx being a leading figure and a member of its General Council. Bakunin\\'s faction (the Jura Federation) and Proudhon\\'s followers (the mutualists) opposed Marxist state socialism, advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings. After bitter disputes, the Bakuninists were expelled from the International by the Marxists at the 1872 Hague Congress. Bakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by Marx\\'s terms, they would end up the new tyrants of workers. After being expelled, anarchists formed the St. Imier International. Under the influence of Peter Kropotkin, a Russian philosopher and scientist, anarcho-communism overlapped with collectivism. Anarcho-communists, who drew inspiration from the 1871 Paris Commune, advocated for free federation and for the distribution of goods according to one\\'s needs.\\n\\nAt the turn of the century, anarchism had spread all over the world. In China, small groups of students imported the humanistic pro-science version of anarcho-communism. Tokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the far east, travelling to the Japanese capital to study. In Latin America, Argentina was a stronghold for anarcho-syndicalism, where it became the most prominent left-wing ideology. During this time, a minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary political violence. This strategy became known as propaganda of the deed. The dismemberment of the French socialist movement into many groups, and the execution and exile of many Communards to penal colonies following the suppression of the Paris Commune, favoured individualist political expression and acts. Even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts, infamy came upon the movement. Illegalism was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during this period.\\nAnarchists enthusiastically participated in the Russian Revolution—despite concerns—in opposition to the Whites. However, they met harsh suppression after the Bolshevik government was stabilized. Several anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to Ukraine, notably leading to the Kronstadt rebellion and Nestor Makhno\\'s struggle in the Free Territory. With the anarchists being crushed in Russia, two new antithetical currents emerged, namely platformism and synthesis anarchism. The former sought to create a coherent group that would push for revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party. Seeing the victories of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War, many workers and activists turned to communist parties, which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, members of major syndicalist movements, the General Confederation of Labour and Industrial Workers of the World, left their organisations and joined the Communist International.\\n\\nIn the Spanish Civil War, anarchists and syndicalists (CNT and FAI) once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists. A long tradition of Spanish anarchism led to anarchists playing a pivotal role in the war. In response to the army rebellion, an anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain, where they collectivised the land. The Soviet Union provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war, but the result was a bitter fight among communists and anarchists at a series of events named May Days as Joseph Stalin tried to seize control of the Republicans.\\n\\nAt the end of World War II, the anarchist movement was severely weakened. However, the 1960s witnessed a revival of anarchism likely caused by a perceived failure of Marxism–Leninism and tensions built by the Cold War. During this time, anarchism took root in other movements critical towards both the state and capitalism, such as the anti-nuclear, environmental and pacifist movements, the New Left, and the counterculture of the 1960s. Anarchism became associated with punk subculture, as exemplified by bands such as Crass and the Sex Pistols, and the established feminist tendencies of anarcha-feminism returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism.\\n\\nAround the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence within anti-war, anti-capitalist, and anti-globalisation movements. Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the World Trade Organization, the Group of Eight and the World Economic Forum. During the protests, \"ad hoc\" leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with the police. Other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture, affinity groups, and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet. A significant event of this period was the confrontations at the WTO conference in Seattle in 1999. Anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the Zapatistas in Mexico and the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria, more commonly known as Rojava, a \"de facto\" autonomous region in northern Syria.\\n\\nAnarchist schools of thought have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions, social anarchism and individualist anarchism, owing to their different origins, values and evolution. The individualist current emphasises negative liberty in opposing restraints upon the free individual, while the social current emphasises positive liberty in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and social ownership. In a chronological sense, anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late 19th century, and the post-classical currents (such as anarcha-feminism, green anarchism and post-anarchism) developed thereafter.\\n\\nBeyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies philosophical anarchism, which holds that the state lacks moral legitimacy, without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it. A component especially of individualist anarchism, philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of a minimal state, but argues that citizens have no moral obligation to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy. Anarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since ethics have a central role in anarchist philosophy.\\n\\nOne reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives, a call for toleration and unity among anarchists first adopted by Fernando Tarrida del Mármol in 1889 in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time. Despite separation, the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities, but as tendencies that intermingle.\\n\\nAnarchism is usually placed on the far-left of the political spectrum. Much of its economics and legal philosophy reflect anti-authoritarian, anti-statist, and libertarian interpretations of the radical left-wing and socialist politics of collectivism, communism, individualism, mutualism, and syndicalism, among other libertarian socialist economic theories. As anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview, many anarchist types and traditions exist, and varieties of anarchy diverge widely.\\n\\nInceptive currents among classical anarchist currents were mutualism and individualism. They were followed by the major currents of social anarchism (collectivist, communist, and syndicalist). They differ on organizational and economic aspects of their ideal society.\\n\\nMutualism is an 18th-century economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon. Its aims include reciprocity, free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform that would be regulated by a bank of the people. Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism. Proudhon first characterised his goal as a \"third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property\".\\n\\nCollectivist anarchism, also known as anarchist collectivism or anarcho-collectivism, is a revolutionary socialist form of anarchism commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin. Collectivist anarchists advocate collective ownership of the means of production, theorised to be achieved through violent revolution, and that workers be paid according to time worked, rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism. Collectivist anarchism arose alongside Marxism, but rejected the dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society. Anarcho-communism, also known as anarchist-communism, communist anarchism, and libertarian communism, is a theory of anarchism that advocates a communist society with common ownership of the means of production, direct democracy, and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers\\' councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: \"From each according to his ability, to each according to his need\". Anarcho-communism developed from radical socialist currents after the French Revolution, but it was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the First International. It was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of Peter Kropotkin.\\n\\nAnarcho-syndicalism, also referred to as revolutionary syndicalism, is a branch of anarchism that views labour syndicates as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are workers\\' solidarity, direct action, and workers\\' self-management.\\n\\nIndividualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants. Early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include William Godwin, Max Stirner and Henry David Thoreau. Through many countries, individualist anarchism attracted a small yet diverse following of Bohemian artists and intellectuals as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation.\\n\\nAnarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left. Interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the anti-globalization movement, whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation. As the movement shaped 21st century radicalism, wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest. Contemporary news coverage which emphasizes black bloc demonstrations has reinforced anarchism\\'s historical association with chaos and violence, although its publicity has also led more scholars to engage with the anarchist movement. Anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements—at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources, and syncretic, combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches. The anti-capitalist tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents.\\n\\nVarious anarchist groups, tendencies, and schools of thought exist today, making it difficult to describe contemporary anarchist movement. While theorists and activists have established \"relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles\", there is no consensus on which principles are core. As a result, commentators describe multiple \"anarchisms\" (rather than a singular \"anarchism\") in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently. For example, gender equality can be a common principle but ranks as a higher priority to anarcha-feminists than anarchist communists. Anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms, namely \"all centralized and hierarchical forms of government (e.g., monarchy, representative democracy, state socialism, etc.), economic class systems (e.g., capitalism, Bolshevism, feudalism, slavery, etc.), autocratic religions (e.g., fundamentalist Islam, Roman Catholicism, etc.), patriarchy, heterosexism, white supremacy, and imperialism\". However, anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed.\\n\\nAnarchists\\' tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goals—first, to oppose the Establishment; and second, to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society, illustrating the unity of means and ends. A broad categorization can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary means, and aims to change society through evolutionary means. Evolutionary tactics reject violence and take a gradual approach to anarchist aims, though there is significant overlap between the two.\\n\\nAnarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century. Anarchists during the early 20th century focused more on strikes and militancy, while contemporary anarchists use a broader array of approaches.\\n\\nDuring the classical era, anarchists had a militant tendency. Not only did they confront state armed forces (as in Spain and Ukraine) but some of them also employed terrorism as propaganda of the deed. Assassination attempts were carried out against heads of state, some of which were successful. Anarchists also took part in revolutions. Anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been perplexing and controversial. On one hand, anarcho-pacifists point out the unity of means and ends. On the other hand, other anarchist groups advocate direct action, a tactic which can include acts of sabotage or even acts of terrorism. This attitude was quite prominent a century ago; seeing the state as a tyrant, some anarchists believed that they had every right to oppose its oppression by any means possible. Emma Goldman and Errico Malatesta, who were proponents of limited use of violence, argued that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a necessary evil.\\n\\nAnarchists took an active role in strikes, although they tended to be antipathetic to formal syndicalism, seeing it as reformist. They saw it as a part of the movement which sought to overthrow the state and capitalism. Anarchists also reinforced their propaganda within the arts, some of whom practiced nudism. They also built communities which were based on friendship. They were also involved in the press.\\n\\nIn the current era, Italian anarchist Alfredo Bonanno, a proponent of insurrectionary anarchism, has reinstated the debate on violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late 19th century by Kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards. Both Bonanno and the French group The Invisible Committee advocate for small, informal affiliation groups, where each member is responsible for their own actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state, capitalism and other enemies. Members of The Invisible Committee were arrested in 2008 on various charges, terrorism included.\\n\\nOverall, today\\'s anarchists are much less violent and militant than their ideological ancestors. They mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots, especially in countries like Canada, Mexico or Greece. Μilitant black bloc protest groups are known for clashing with the police. However, anarchists not only clash with state operators; they also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists, taking anti-fascist action and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening.\\n\\nAnarchists commonly employ direct action. This can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchy, or the form of self-managing their lives through the creation of counter-institutions such as communes and non-hierarchical collectives. Often, decision-making is handled in an anti-authoritarian way, with everyone having equal say in each decision, an approach known as horizontalism. Contemporary-era anarchists have been engaging with various grassroots movements that are not explicitly anarchist but are more or less based on horizontalism, respecting personal autonomy, and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations. The newly coined term \"small-a anarchism\", in contrast with the \"big-A anarchism\" of the classical era, signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classical-era anarchism or to refer to Kropotkin or Proudhon to justify their opinions. They would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience, which they will later theorize.\\n\\nThe decision-making process of small affinity anarchist groups play a significant tactical role. Anarchists have employed various methods in order to build a rough consensus among members of their group, without the need of a leader or a leading group. One way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to help achieve a consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting a specific point. Minorities usually accept rough consensus, except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist goals, values, or ethics. Anarchists usually form small groups (5–20 individuals) to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members. These kind of groups more often than not interconnect with each other, forming larger networks. Anarchists still support and participate in strikes, especially wildcat strikes; these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by a syndicate.\\n\\nAnarchists have gone online to spread their message. As in the past, newspapers and journals are used; however, because of distributional and other difficulties, anarchists have found it easier to create websites, hosting electronic libraries and other portals. Anarchists were also involved in developing various software that are available for free. The way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals, especially when it comes to preserving users\\' privacy from state surveillance.\\n\\nAnarchists organize themselves to squat and reclaim public spaces. During important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied, they are often called Temporary Autonomous Zones (TAZ), spaces where surrealism, poetry and art are blended to display the anarchist ideal. As seen by anarchists, squatting is a way to regain urban space from the capitalist market, serving pragmatical needs, and is also seen an exemplary direct action. Acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds. Adding up these tactics, and having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them, along with various forms of protesting at highly symbolic events, make up a carnivalesque atmosphere that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity.\\n\\nAs anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies, and schools of thought, and disagreement over questions of values, ideology, and tactics is common, its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has created a number of definitional concerns in anarchist theory. For instance, the compatibility of capitalism, nationalism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as Marxism, communism, collectivism and trade unionism. Anarchists may be motivated by humanism, divine authority, enlightened self-interest, veganism, or any number of alternative ethical doctrines. Phenomena such as civilisation, technology (e.g. within anarcho-primitivism) and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.\\n\\nGender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy; anarchism is obliged to address, analyse and oppose the suppression of one\\'s autonomy because of the dynamics that gender roles traditionally impose.\\n\\nA historical current that arose and flourished during 1890 and 1920 within anarchism was free love; in contemporary anarchism, this current survives as a tendency to support polyamory and queer anarchism. Free love advocates were against marriage, which they saw as a way of men imposing authority over women, largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men. The notion of free love, though, was much broader; it included critique of the established order that limited women\\'s sexual freedom and pleasure. Such free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses, where large groups of travelers, anarchists, and other activists slept in beds together. Free love had roots both in Europe and the United States. Some anarchists, however, struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love. Anarchist feminists were advocates of free love, against marriage, were pro-choice (utilizing a contemporary term) and had a likewise agenda. Anarchist and non-anarchist feminists differed on suffrage, but were nonetheless supportive of one another.\\n\\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, anarchism intermingled with the second wave of feminism, radicalizing some currents of the feminist movement (and being influenced as well). By the latest decades of the 20th century, anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women, gays, queers and other marginalized groups, with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents. With the third wave of feminism, sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became a subject of study for anarchists, which yielded a post-structuralist critique of sexual normality. However, some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking, suggesting that it leaned towards individualism and was, therefore, dropping the cause of social liberation.\\n\\nThe interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism. Anarchists consider \\'proper\\' education, which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society, to be an act of mutual aid. Anarchist writers such as Willian Godwin and Max Stirner attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges.\\n\\nIn 1901, Catalan anarchist and free thinker Francisco Ferrer established the Escuela Moderna in Barcelona as an opposition to the established education system, which was dictated largely by the Catholic Church. Ferrer\\'s approach was secular, rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational process, and gave pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance. Ferrer aimed to educate the working class and explicitly sought to foster class consciousness among students. The school closed after constant harassment by the state and Ferrer was later arrested. His ideas, however, formed the inspiration for a series of modern schools around the world. Christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy also established a similar school, with its founding principle, according to Tolstoy, being that \"for education to be effective it had to be free\". In a similar token, A. S. Neill founding what became Summerhill School in 1921, also declaring being free from coercion.\\n\\nAnarchist education is based largely on the idea that a child\\'s right to develop freely, without manipulation, ought to be respected, and that rationality will lead children to morally good conclusions. However, there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation; Ferrer, for example, believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality, liberty, and social justice were not possible under capitalism (along with other critiques of nationalism and government).\\n\\nLate 20th century and contemporary anarchist writers (such as Colin Ward, Herbert Read and Paul Goodman) intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education, largely focusing on the need for a system that focuses on children\\'s creativity rather than on their ability to attain a career or participate in consumer society. Contemporary anarchists, such as Colin Ward, have further argued that state education serves to perpetuate socio-economic inequality.\\n\\nWhile few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modern day, major tenets of anarchist schools, such as respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method, have spread among mainstream educational institutions.\\n\\nObjection to the state and its institutions is a \"sine qua non\" of anarchism. Anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and believe it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies. Instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life, major decisions are taken by a small elite. Authority ultimately rests solely on power, regardless of whether that power is open or transparent, as it still has the ability to coerce people. Another anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting a government, even the most altruistic among officials, will unavoidably seek to gain more power, leading to corruption. Anarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an unachievable fiction, due to the fact that the ruling class is distinct from the rest of society.\\n\\nThe connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism, especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era, such as futurists, surrealists, and others, while in literature anarchism was mostly associated with the New Apocalyptics and the Neo-romanticism movement. In music, anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as punk. Anarchists such as Leo Tolstoy and Herbert Read argued that the border between the artist and the non-artist, what separates art from a daily act, is a construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism, and it prevents humans from living a joyful life.\\n\\nOther anarchists advocated for or used art as a means to achieve anarchist ends. In his book Breaking the Spell: A History of Anarchist Filmmakers, Videotape Guerrillas, and Digital Ninjas, Chris Robé claims that \"anarchist-inflected practices have increasingly structured movement-based video activism.\"\\n\\nThroughout the 20th century many prominent Anarchists, such as Peter Kropotkin, Emma Goldman, Gustav Landauer, and Camillo Berneri, and publications, such as \"Anarchy\", wrote about matters pertaining to the arts.\\n\\nThree overlapping properties made art useful to anarchists: It could depict a critique of existing society and hierarchies; it could serve as a prefigurative tool to reflect the anarchist ideal society, and also it could turn into a means of direct action, in protests for example. As it appeals to both emotion and reason, art could appeal to the \"whole human\" and have a powerful effect.\\n\\nThe most common critique of Anarchism is that humans can not self govern and a state is necessary for human survival. Philosopher Bertrand Russell supported this critique, noting that \"Peace and war, tariffs, regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs, the preservation of a just system of distribution: these, among others, are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government.\"\\n\\nPhilosophy lecturer Andrew G. Fiala also believed that humans could not self govern and included it in his list of arguments against anarchism. Fiala\\'s other critiques were that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction, not only in the pragmatic world (i.e. at protests) but in the world of ethics as well. Secondly, anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state can not be defeated practically; this line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it. The third argument is that anarchism is self-contradictory since while it advocates for no-one to \"archiei\", if accepted by the many, then anarchism will turn into the ruling political theory. In this line of criticism also comes the self contradiction that anarchist calls for collective action while anarchism endorses the autonomy of the individual and hence no collective action can be taken. Lastly, Fiala mentions a critique towards philosophical anarchism, of being ineffective (all talk and thoughts) and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong.\\n\\nPhilosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia, following the release of pro-anarchist books such as A. John Simmons\\' \"Moral Principles and Political Obligations\" (1979). Law professor William A. Edmundson authored an essay arguing against three major philosophical anarchist principles, which he finds fallacious; Edmundson claims that while the individual does not owe a normal state a duty of obedience, this does not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion, and the state is still morally legitimate.\\n\\nAcademic John Molyneux notes in his book \"Anarchism: A Marxist Criticism\" that \"anarchism cannot win\" believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"25\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25\" title=\"Autism\">\\nAutism\\n\\nAutism is a developmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents often notice signs during the first three years of their child\\'s life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism experience worsening in their communication and social skills after reaching developmental milestones at a normal pace.\\nAutism is associated with a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors during pregnancy include certain infections, such as rubella, toxins including valproic acid, alcohol, cocaine, pesticides, lead, and air pollution, fetal growth restriction, and autoimmune diseases. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example, the vaccine hypothesis, which has been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the brain and how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), combines autism and less severe forms of the condition, including Asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) into the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).\\nEarly behavioral interventions or speech therapy can help children with autism gain self-care, social, and communication skills. Although there is no known cure, there have been cases of children who recovered. Some autistic adults are unable to live independently. An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference to be accommodated instead of cured.\\nGlobally, autism is estimated to affect 24.8 million people . In the 2000s, the number of people affected was estimated at 1–2 per 1,000 people worldwide. In the developed countries, about 1.5% of children are diagnosed with ASD , from 0.7% in 2000 in the United States. It occurs four-to-five times more often in males than females. The number of people diagnosed has increased dramatically since the 1960s, which may be partly due to changes in diagnostic practice. The question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved.\\nAutism is a highly variable, neurodevelopmental disorder whose symptoms first appear during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without remission. People with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but average, or even superior, in others. Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form. It is distinguished by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction, impairments in communication, and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis. Individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.\\n\\nSocial deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders (ASD; see Classification) from other developmental disorders. People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic Temple Grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals, or people with typical neural development, as leaving her feeling \"like an anthropologist on Mars\".\\n\\nUnusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms; for example, they have less eye contact and turn-taking, and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things. Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form attachments to their primary caregivers. Most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less pronounced autistic traits. Older children and adults with ASD perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person\\'s own emotions.\\n\\nChildren with high-functioning autism have more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply.\\nThere are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with intellectual disability, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and meltdowns.\\n\\nAbout a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others\\' words (echolalia) or reverse pronouns. Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD. For example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.\\n\\nIn a pair of studies, high-functioning children with autism aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and as adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.\\n\\nAutistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) categorizes as follows.\\n\\n\\nNo single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.\\n\\nAutistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but that can affect the individual or the family.\\nAn estimated 0.5% to 10% of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants. Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population. Sensory abnormalities are found in over 90% of those with autism, and are considered core features by some, although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements). An estimated 60–80% of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone, poor motor planning, and toe walking; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper. Unusual eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator. Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur.\\n\\nThere is tentative evidence that autism occurs more frequently in people with gender dysphoria.\\n\\nGastrointestinal problems are one of the most commonly associated medical disorders in people with autism. These are linked to greater social impairment, irritability, behavior and sleep problems, language impairments and mood changes.\\n\\nParents of children with ASD have higher levels of stress. Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with Down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship. However, they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with Down syndrome; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults.\\n\\nIt has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autism\\'s characteristic triad of symptoms. However, there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur.\\nAutism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants. Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression. Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents. Studies of twins suggest that heritability is 0.7 for autism and as high as 0.9 for ASD, and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population. However, most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified. Typically, autism cannot be traced to a Mendelian (single-gene) mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality, and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASDs have been shown to selectively cause ASD. Numerous candidate genes have been located, with only small effects attributable to any particular gene. Most loci individually explain less than 1% of cases of autism. The large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural variation—such as deletions, duplications or inversions in genetic material during meiosis. Hence, a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited: that is, the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome. Autism may be underdiagnosed in women and girls due to an assumption that it is primarily a male condition, but genetic phenomena such as imprinting and X linkage have the ability to raise the frequency and severity of conditions in males, and theories have been put forward for a genetic reason why males are diagnosed more often, such as the imprinted brain theory and the extreme male brain theory.\\n\\nMaternal nutrition and inflammation during preconception and pregnancy influences fetal neurodevelopment. Intrauterine growth restriction is associated with ASD, in both term and preterm infants. Maternal inflammatory and autoimmune diseases may damage fetal tissues, aggravating a genetic problem or damaging the nervous system.\\n\\nExposure to air pollution during pregnancy, especially heavy metals and particulates, may increase the risk of autism. Environmental factors that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods, infectious diseases, solvents, PCBs, phthalates and phenols used in plastic products, pesticides, brominated flame retardants, alcohol, smoking, illicit drugs, vaccines, and prenatal stress. Some, such as the MMR vaccine, have been completely disproven.\\n\\nParents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination. This has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine \"overload\", a vaccine preservative, or the MMR vaccine for causing autism. The latter theory was supported by a litigation-funded study that has since been shown to have been \"an elaborate fraud\". Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible, parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations, outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children.\\n\\nAutism\\'s symptoms result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain. How autism occurs is not well understood. Its mechanism can be divided into two areas: the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism, and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors. The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies.\\n\\nThere is evidence that gut–brain axis abnormalities may be involved. A 2015 review proposed that immune dysregulation, gastrointestinal inflammation, malfunction of the autonomic nervous system, gut flora alterations, and food metabolites may cause brain neuroinflammation and dysfunction. A 2016 review concludes that enteric nervous system abnormalities might play a role in neurological disorders such as autism. Neural connections and the immune system are a pathway that may allow diseases originated in the intestine to spread to the brain.\\n\\nSeveral lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism. Some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways, such as those involved with cell adhesion. Gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity-dependent changes. All known teratogens (agents that cause birth defects) related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception, and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later, there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development.\\n\\nDiagnosis is based on behavior, not cause or mechanism. Under the DSM-5, autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts, as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. These deficits are present in early childhood, typically before age three, and lead to clinically significant functional impairment. Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language, and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects. The disturbance must not be better accounted for by Rett syndrome, intellectual disability or global developmental delay. ICD-10 uses essentially the same definition.\\n\\nSeveral diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) uses observation and interaction with the child. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children. The Diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders (DISCO) may also be used.\\n\\nA pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated medical conditions. A pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions. A differential diagnosis for ASD at this stage might also consider intellectual disability, hearing impairment, and a specific language impairment such as Landau–Kleffner syndrome. The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression.\\n\\nClinical genetics evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause. Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes, consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and fragile X testing. A genotype-first model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome\\'s copy number variations. As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge. Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results, given the complexity of autism\\'s genetics. Metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful, but are not routine.\\n\\nASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later. In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice. Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits. Girls are often diagnosed later than boys.\\n\\nUnderdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis. It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired, partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindisms.\\n\\nAutism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior. These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.\\n\\nOf the five PDD forms, Asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; PDD not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS; also called \"atypical autism\") is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder. Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development. The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the \"autism spectrum disorders\" (ASD) or sometimes the \"autistic disorders\", whereas autism itself is often called \"autistic disorder\", \"childhood autism\", or \"infantile autism\". In this article, \"autism\" refers to the classic autistic disorder; in clinical practice, though, \"autism\", \"ASD\", and \"PDD\" are often used interchangeably. ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism phenotype, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like traits, such as avoiding eye contact.\\n\\nAutism can also be divided into syndromal and non-syndromal autism; the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound intellectual disability or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms, such as tuberous sclerosis. Although individuals with Asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism, the extent of the overlap between Asperger syndrome, HFA, and non-syndromal autism is unclear.\\n\\nSome studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills, as opposed to a failure to make progress, typically from 15 to 30 months of age. The validity of this distinction remains controversial; it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype, or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression.\\n\\nResearch into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry, psychology, neurology and pediatrics. Newer technologies such as fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes (observable traits) that can be viewed on brain scans, to help further neurogenetic studies of autism; one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain, which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects. It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior.\\n\\nAutism has long been thought to cover a wide spectrum, ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent, developmentally disabled, and prone to frequent repetitive behavior such as hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, pedantic communication. Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary. Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- or high-functioning autism (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on IQ thresholds. Some people have called for an end to the terms \"high-functioning\" and \"low-functioning\" due to lack of nuance and the potential for a person\\'s needs or abilities to be overlooked.\\n\\nAbout half of parents of children with ASD notice their child\\'s unusual behaviors by age 18 months, and about four-fifths notice by age 24 months. According to an article, failure to meet any of the following milestones \"is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations. Delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long-term outcome\".\\n\\nThe United States Preventive Services Task Force in 2016 found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concerns. The Japanese practice is to screen all children for ASD at 18 and 24 months, using autism-specific formal screening tests. In contrast, in the UK, children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened. It is not known which approach is more effective. Screening tools include the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire, and the First Year Inventory; initial data on M-CHAT and its predecessor, the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT), on children aged 18–30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity (many false-negatives) but good specificity (few false-positives). It may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish ASD from other developmental disorders. Screening tools designed for one culture\\'s norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture. Although genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical, it can be considered in some cases, such as children with neurological symptoms and dysmorphic features.\\n\\nWhile infection with rubella during pregnancy causes fewer than 1% of cases of autism, vaccination against rubella can prevent many of those cases.\\n\\nThe main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase quality of life and functional independence. In general, higher IQs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes. No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child\\'s needs. Families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment. Services should be carried out by behavior analysts, special education teachers, speech pathologists, and licensed psychologists. Studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy. However, the development of evidence-based interventions has advanced in recent years. Although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment, the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options. Intensive, sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self-care, communication, and job skills, and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated. While medications have not been found to help with core symptoms, they may be used for associated symptoms, such as irritability, inattention, or repetitive behavior patterns.\\n\\nEducational interventions often used include applied behavior analysis (ABA), developmental models, structured teaching, speech and language therapy, social skills therapy, and occupational therapy and cognitive behavioral interventions in adults without intellectual disability to reduce depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Among these approaches, interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively, or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit. The quality of research for early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI)—a treatment procedure incorporating over thirty hours per week of the structured type of ABA that is carried out with very young children—is currently low, and more vigorous research designs with larger sample sizes are needed. Two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include structured and naturalistic ABA interventions, and developmental social pragmatic models (DSP). One interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model, which teaches parents how to implement various ABA and DSP techniques, allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves. Various DSP programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at-home parent implementation. Despite the recent development of parent training models, these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies, being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment.\\n\\nEarly, intensive ABA therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing communication and adaptive functioning in preschool children; it is also well-established for improving the intellectual performance of that age group. Similarly, a teacher-implemented intervention that utilizes a more naturalistic form of ABA combined with a developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be beneficial in improving social-communication skills in young children, although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms. Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided. It is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up, and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results. The appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers.\\n\\nMedications may be used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails. They may also be used for associated health problems, such as ADHD or anxiety. More than half of US children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants, with the most common drug classes being antidepressants, stimulants, and antipsychotics. The atypical antipsychotic drugs risperidone and aripiprazole are FDA-approved for treating associated aggressive and self-injurious behaviors. However, their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits, and people with autism may respond atypically. Side effects, for example, may include weight gain, tiredness, drooling, and aggression. SSRI antidepressants, such as fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, have been shown to be effective in reducing repetitive and ritualistic behaviors, while the stimulant medication methylphenidate is beneficial for some children with co-morbid inattentiveness or hyperactivity. There is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD. No known medication relieves autism\\'s core symptoms of social and communication impairments. Experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function, suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism.\\n\\nAlthough many alternative therapies and interventions are available, few are supported by scientific studies. Treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality-of-life contexts, and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real-world relevance. Some alternative treatments may place the child at risk. The preference that children with autism have for unconventional foods can lead to reduction in bone cortical thickness with this being greater in those on casein-free diets, as a consequence of the low intake of calcium and vitamin D; however, suboptimal bone development in ASD has also been associated with lack of exercise and gastrointestinal disorders. In 2005, botched chelation therapy killed a five-year-old child with autism. Chelation is not recommended for people with ASD since the associated risks outweigh any potential benefits. Another alternative medicine practice with no evidence is CEASE therapy, a mixture of homeopathy, supplements, and \\'vaccine detoxing\\'.\\n\\nAlthough popularly used as an alternative treatment for people with autism, as of 2018 there is no good evidence to recommend a gluten- and casein-free diet as a standard treatment. A 2018 review concluded that it may be a therapeutic option for specific groups of children with autism, such as those with known food intolerances or allergies, or with food intolerance markers. The authors analyzed the prospective trials conducted to date that studied the efficacy of the gluten- and casein-free diet in children with ASD (4 in total). All of them compared gluten- and casein-free diet versus normal diet with a control group (2 double-blind randomized controlled trials, 1 double-blind crossover trial, 1 single-blind trial). In two of the studies, whose duration was 12 and 24 months, a significant improvement in ASD symptoms (efficacy rate 50%) was identified. In the other two studies, whose duration was 3 months, no significant effect was observed. The authors concluded that a longer duration of the diet may be necessary to achieve the improvement of the ASD symptoms. Other problems documented in the trials carried out include transgressions of the diet, small sample size, the heterogeneity of the participants and the possibility of a placebo effect. In the subset of people who have gluten sensitivity there is limited evidence that suggests that a gluten-free diet may improve some autistic behaviors.\\n\\nResults of a systematic review on interventions to address health outcomes among autistic adults found emerging evidence to support mindfulness-based interventions for improving mental health. This includes decreasing stress, anxiety, ruminating thoughts, anger, and aggression. There is tentative evidence that music therapy may improve social interactions, verbal communication, and non-verbal communication skills. There has been early research looking at hyperbaric treatments in children with autism. Studies on pet therapy have shown positive effects.\\n\\nThere is no known cure. The degree of symptoms can decrease, occasionally to the extent that people lose their diagnosis of ASD; this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not. It is not known how often recovery happens; reported rates in unselected samples have ranged from 3% to 25%. Most children with autism acquire language by age five or younger, though a few have developed communication skills in later years. Many children with autism lack social support, future employment opportunities or self-determination. Although core difficulties tend to persist, symptoms often become less severe with age.\\n\\nFew high-quality studies address long-term prognosis. Some adults show modest improvement in communication skills, but a few decline; no study has focused on autism after midlife. Acquiring language before age six, having an IQ above 50, and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes; independent living is unlikely with severe autism.\\n\\nMany individuals with autism face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood. Compared to the general population individuals with autism are more likely to be unemployed and to have never had a job. About half of people in their 20s with autism are not employed.\\n\\nMost recent reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of 1–2 per 1,000 for autism and close to 6 per 1,000 for ASD as of 2007. A 2016 survey in the United States reported a rate of 25 per 1,000 children for ASD. Globally, autism affects an estimated 24.8 million people , while Asperger syndrome affects a further 37.2 million. In 2012, the NHS estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the UK was 1.1%. Rates of PDD-NOS\\'s has been estimated at 3.7 per 1,000, Asperger syndrome at roughly 0.6 per 1,000, and childhood disintegrative disorder at 0.02 per 1,000. CDC estimates about 1 out of 59 (1.7%) for 2014, an increase from 1 out of every 68 children (1.5%) for 2010.\\n\\nThe number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s. This increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices, referral patterns, availability of services, age at diagnosis, and public awareness, though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out. The available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism\\'s true prevalence has increased; a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics.\\n\\nBoys are at higher risk for ASD than girls. The sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with intellectual disability and more than 5.5:1 without. Several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated, but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed; one theory is that females are underdiagnosed.\\n\\nAlthough the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy-related risk factor as a cause of autism, the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent, and with diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy. The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism. Most professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism.\\n\\nSeveral other conditions are common in children with autism. They include:\\n\\nA few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. The \"Table Talk\" of Martin Luther, compiled by his notetaker, Mathesius, contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic. Luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil, and suggested that he be suffocated, although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report. The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue, as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair\\'s marriage to gain Blair\\'s inheritance. The Wild Boy of Aveyron, a feral child caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student Jean Itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.\\n\\nThe New Latin word \"autismus\" (English translation \"autism\") was coined by the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia. He derived it from the Greek word \"autós\" (αὐτός, meaning \"self\"), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to \"autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance\". A Soviet child psychiatrist, Grunya Sukhareva, described a similar syndrome that was published in Russian in 1925, and in German in 1926.\\n\\nThe word \"autism\" first took its modern sense in 1938 when Hans Asperger of the Vienna University Hospital adopted Bleuler\\'s terminology \"autistic psychopaths\" in a lecture in German about child psychology. Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as Asperger syndrome, though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981. Leo Kanner of the Johns Hopkins Hospital first used \"autism\" in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label \"early infantile autism\" in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities. Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner\\'s first paper on the subject, notably \"autistic aloneness\" and \"insistence on sameness\", are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders. It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.\\n\\nDonald Triplett was the first person diagnosed with autism. He was diagnosed by Kanner after being first examined in 1938, and was labeled as \"case 1\". Triplett was noted for his savant abilities, particularly being able to name musical notes played on a piano and to mentally multiply numbers. His father, Oliver, described him as socially withdrawn but interested in number patterns, music notes, letters of the alphabet, and U.S. president pictures. By the age of 2, he had the ability to recite the 23rd Psalm and memorized 25 questions and answers from the Presbyterian catechism. He was also interested in creating musical chords.\\n\\nKanner\\'s reuse of \"autism\" led to decades of confused terminology like \"infantile schizophrenia\", and child psychiatry\\'s focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant\\'s response to \"refrigerator mothers\". Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome.\\n\\nAs late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; while in 2007 it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions. Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have affected how ASD is viewed, parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their child\\'s autistic behavior is perceived negatively, and many primary care physicians and medical specialists express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.\\n\\nIt took until 1980 for the DSM-III to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia. In 1987, the DSM-III-R provided a checklist for diagnosing autism. In May 2013, the DSM-5 was released, updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders. The grouping of disorders, including PDD-NOS, autism, Asperger syndrome, Rett syndrome, and CDD, has been removed and replaced with the general term of Autism Spectrum Disorders. The two categories that exist are impaired social communication and/or interaction, and restricted and/or repetitive behaviors.\\n\\nThe Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find difficult to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely. Societal and cultural aspects of autism have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that autism is simply another way of being.\\n\\nAn autistic culture has emerged, accompanied by the autistic rights and neurodiversity movements. Events include World Autism Awareness Day, Autism Sunday, Autistic Pride Day, Autreat, and others. Organizations dedicated to promoting awareness of autism include Autistic Self Advocacy Network, Aspies For Freedom, Autism National Committee, and Autism Society of America. At the same time, some organizations, including Autism Speaks, have been condemned by disability rights organizations for failing to support autistic people. Social-science scholars study those with autism in hopes to learn more about \"autism as a culture, transcultural comparisons... and research on social movements.\" While most autistic individuals do not have savant skills, many have been successful in their fields.\\n\\nThe autism rights movement is a social movement within the context of disability rights that emphasizes the concept of neurodiversity, viewing the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the human brain rather than a disorder to be cured. The autism rights movement advocates for including greater acceptance of autistic behaviors; therapies that focus on coping skills rather than on imitating the behaviors of those without autism, and the recognition of the autistic community as a minority group. Autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the human genome. This perspective is distinct from two other likewise distinct views: the medical perspective, that autism is caused by a genetic defect and should be addressed by targeting the autism gene(s), and fringe theories that autism is caused by environmental factors such as vaccines. A common criticism against autistic activists is that the majority of them are \"high-functioning\" or have Asperger syndrome and do not represent the views of \"low-functioning\" autistic people. \\n\\nAbout half of autistics are unemployed, and one third of those with graduate degrees may be unemployed. Among autistics who find work, most are employed in sheltered settings working for wages below the national minimum. While employers state hiring concerns about productivity and supervision, experienced employers of autistics give positive reports of above average memory and detail orientation as well as a high regard for rules and procedure in autistic employees. A majority of the economic burden of autism is caused by decreased earnings in the job market. Some studies also find decreased earning among parents who care for autistic children.\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"39\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39\" title=\"Albedo\">\\nAlbedo\\n\\nAlbedo () (, meaning \\'whiteness\\') is the measure of the diffuse reflection of solar radiation out of the total solar radiation and measured on a scale from 0, corresponding to a black body that absorbs all incident radiation, to 1, corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation.\\n\\nSurface albedo is defined as the ratio of radiosity to the irradiance (flux per unit area) received by a surface. The proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth\\'s surface. These factors vary with atmospheric composition, geographic location and time (see position of the Sun). While bi-hemispherical reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence (i.e., for a given position of the Sun), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period. The temporal resolution may range from seconds (as obtained from flux measurements) to daily, monthly, or annual averages.\\n\\nUnless given for a specific wavelength (spectral albedo), albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation. Due to measurement constraints, it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface (between 0.3 and 3 μm). This spectrum includes visible light (0.4–0.7 μm), which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark (e.g., trees absorb most radiation), whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright (e.g., snow reflects most radiation).\\n\\nAlbedo is an important concept in climatology, astronomy, and environmental management (e.g., as part of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program for sustainable rating of buildings). The average albedo of the Earth from the upper atmosphere, its \"planetary albedo\", is 30–35% because of cloud cover, but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features.\\n\\nThe term albedo was introduced into optics by Johann Heinrich Lambert in his 1760 work \"Photometria\".\\n\\nAny albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4. The average albedo of Earth is about 0.3. This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.\\nEarth\\'s surface albedo is regularly estimated via Earth observation satellite sensors such as NASA\\'s MODIS instruments on board the Terra and Aqua satellites, and the CERES instrument on the Suomi NPP and JPSS. As the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite, not all directions, a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional-hemispherical reflectance and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.,). These calculations are based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle. BDRF can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo.\\n\\nEarth\\'s average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about 15\\xa0°C. If Earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective), the average temperature of the planet would drop below −40\\xa0°C. If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0\\xa0°C. In contrast, if the entire Earth was covered by water – a so-called ocean planet – the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost 27\\xa0°C.\\n\\nFor land surfaces, it has been shown that the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle \"θ\" can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms:\\nwith formula_3 being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle, and formula_4 being the proportion of diffuse illumination, the actual albedo formula_5 (also called blue-sky albedo) can then be given as:\\n\\nThis formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.\\n\\nThe albedos of planets, satellites and minor planets such as asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle (\"phase angle\"), and variation in time composes a major part of the astronomical field of photometry. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer Solar System objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids.\\n\\nEnceladus, a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar System, with an albedo of 0.99. Another notable high-albedo body is Eris, with an albedo of 0.96. Many small objects in the outer Solar System and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about 0.05. A typical comet nucleus has an albedo of 0.04. Such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds.\\n\\nThe overall albedo of the Moon is measured to be around 0.14, but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong opposition effect. Although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless Solar System bodies.\\n\\nTwo common albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) geometric albedo (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the Bond albedo (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.\\n\\nIn detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five Hapke parameters which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle, including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces.\\n\\nThe correlation between astronomical (geometric) albedo, absolute magnitude and diameter is:\\nformula_7,\\n\\nwhere formula_8 is the astronomical albedo, formula_9 is the diameter in kilometers, and formula_10 is the absolute magnitude.\\n\\nAlbedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light, except in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the Earth\\'s surface at that location (e.g. through melting of reflective ice). That said, albedo and illumination both vary by latitude. Albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics, with a local maximum in the tropics.\\n\\nThe intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation (solar irradiance); high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation, whereas areas such as the Sahara Desert, which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation. Tropical and sub-tropical rainforest areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts, which have lower insolation. Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes.\\n\\nArctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb, effectively cooling the Earth. This has been a concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures, creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker (being water or ground which is darker color) and reflects less heat back into space. This feedback loop results in a reduced albedo effect.\\n\\nAlbedo affects climate by determining how much radiation a planet absorbs. The uneven heating of Earth from albedo variations between land, ice, or ocean surfaces can drive weather.\\n\\nWhen an area\\'s albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow–temperature feedback results. A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g., a warm air mass), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow–temperature feedback. However, because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher insolation) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass or soil, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.\\n\\nSnow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow. Over Antarctica snow albedo averages a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice–albedo positive feedback).\\n\\nJust as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow, the albedo of snow-covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water. Sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow. When sea ice melts, either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above, the snow-covered surface is reduced, and more surface of sea water is exposed, so the rate of energy absorption increases. The extra absorbed energy heats the sea water, which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts. As with the preceding example of snowmelt, the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback. Both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important for global warming.\\n\\nCryoconite, powdery windblown dust containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.\\n\\nThe dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback, together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo, can lead to large errors in energy estimates. Because of this, in order to reduce the error of energy estimates, it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions.\\n\\nAlbedo works on a smaller scale, too. In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.\\n\\nAlbedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices. For example, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions. Research showed impacts of over 10%. More recently, the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications.\\n\\nBecause forests generally have a low albedo, (the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis), some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation (or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation). In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect. Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through evapotranspiration. The water vapor causes cooling on the land surface, causes heating where it condenses, acts a strong greenhouse gas, and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds. Scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact, and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate.\\n\\nIn seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. Deciduous trees have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas coniferous trees have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15. Variation in summer albedo across both forest types is correlated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display a greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy. The result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be reflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy.\\n\\nStudies by the Hadley Centre have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g., Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.\\n\\nWater reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the Fresnel equations (see graph).\\n\\nAt the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner (not diffusely). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small angles of incident light, waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.\\n\\nAlthough the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the terminator (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.\\n\\nNote that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh \\'black\\' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.\\nSnow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to 0.9.\\n\\nCloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. \"On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth.\"\\n\\nAlbedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic. A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10\\xa0°C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.\\n\\nAerosols (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on Earth\\'s radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain. As per Spracklen et al. the effects are:\\nAnother albedo-related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m. Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo.\\n\\nHuman activities (e.g., deforestation, farming, and urbanization) change the albedo of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult, further study is required to determine anthropogenic effects.\\n\\nSingle-scattering albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material (refractive index); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"290\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=290\" title=\"A\">\\nA\\n\\nA or a is the first letter and the first vowel letter of the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet. Its name in English is \"a\" (pronounced ), plural \"aes\". It is similar in shape to the Ancient Greek letter alpha, from which it derives. The uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. The lowercase version can be written in two forms: the double-storey a and single-storey ɑ. The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in italic type.\\n\\nIn the English grammar, \"a\", and its variant \"an\", are indefinite articles.\\n\\nThe earliest certain ancestor of \"A\" is aleph (also written \\'aleph), the first letter of the Phoenician alphabet, which consisted entirely of consonants (for that reason, it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from a true alphabet). In turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in proto-Sinaitic script influenced by Egyptian hieroglyphs, styled as a triangular head with two horns extended.\\n\\nBy 1600 BC, the Phoenician alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms. Its name is thought to have corresponded closely to the Paleo-Hebrew or Arabic aleph.\\nWhen the ancient Greeks adopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter to represent the glottal stop—the consonant sound that the letter denoted in Phoenician and other Semitic languages, and that was the first phoneme of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter—so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel , and called it by the similar name of alpha. In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the Greek Dark Ages, dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the Greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.\\n\\nThe Etruscans brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the Italian Peninsula and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the Etruscan alphabet to write the Latin language, and the resulting letter was preserved in the Latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages, including English.\\n\\nDuring Roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter \"A\". First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other \"permanent\" media. There was also a cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces. Due to the \"perishable\" nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as majuscule cursive, minuscule cursive, and semicursive minuscule. Variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles. The known variants include the early semi-uncial, the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.\\n\\nAt the end of the Roman Empire (5th century AD), several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe. Among these were the semicursive minuscule of Italy, the Merovingian script in France, the Visigothic script in Spain, and the Insular or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule of Great Britain. By the 9th century, the Caroline script, which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. This form was derived through a combining of prior forms.\\n\\n15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today. These variants, the \"Italic\" and \"Roman\" forms, were derived from the Caroline Script version. The Italic form, also called \"script a,\" is used in most current handwriting and consists of a circle and vertical stroke. This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter tau in the hands of medieval Irish and English writers. The Roman form is used in most printed material; it consists of a small loop with an arc over it (\"a\"). Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.\\n\\nItalic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest (set in Roman type). There are some other cases aside from italic type where \"script a\" (\"ɑ\"), also called Latin alpha, is used in contrast with Latin \"a\" (such as in the International Phonetic Alphabet).\\n\\nIn modern English orthography, the letter represents at least seven different vowel sounds:\\n\\nThe double sequence does not occur in native English words, but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as \"Aaron\" and \"aardvark\". However, occurs in many common digraphs, all with their own sound or sounds, particularly , , , , and .\\n\\nIn most languages that use the Latin alphabet, denotes an open unrounded vowel, such as , , or . An exception is Saanich, in which (and the glyph Á) stands for a close-mid front unrounded vowel .\\n\\nIn phonetic and phonemic notation:\\n\\nIn algebra, the letter \"a\" along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities, whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet (\"x\", \"y\", \"z\") are used to denote unknown quantities.\\n\\nIn geometry, capital A, B, C etc. are used to denote segments, lines, rays, etc. A capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a triangle, the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A.\\n\\n\"A\" is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A-, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students\\' schoolwork; \"A grade\" for clean restaurants; A-list celebrities, etc. Such associations can have a motivating effect, as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.\\n\\n\"A\" is used as a prefix on some words, such as asymmetry, to mean \"not\" or \"without\" (from Greek).\\n\\nIn English grammar, \"a\", and its variant \"an\", is an indefinite article.\\n\\nFinally, the letter A is used to denote size, as in a narrow size shoe, or a small cup size in a brassiere.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n<doc id=\"303\" url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=303\" title=\"Alabama\">\\nAlabama\\n\\nAlabama () is a state in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama is the 30th largest by area and the 24th-most populous of the U.S. states. With a total of of inland waterways, Alabama has among the most of any state.\\n\\nAlabama is nicknamed the \"Yellowhammer State\", after the state bird. Alabama is also known as the \"Heart of Dixie\" and the \"Cotton State\". The state tree is the longleaf pine, and the state flower is the camellia. Alabama\\'s capital is Montgomery. The largest city by population is Birmingham, which has long been the most industrialized city; the largest city by land area is Huntsville. The oldest city is Mobile, founded by French colonists in 1702 as the capital of French Louisiana. Greater Birmingham is Alabama\\'s largest urban economy, its most populous urban area, and its economic center.\\n\\nFrom the American Civil War until World War II, Alabama, like many states in the southern U.S., suffered economic hardship, in part because of its continued dependence on agriculture. Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed Jim Crow laws to disenfranchise and otherwise discriminate against African Americans from the end of the Reconstruction Era up until at least the 1970s. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, white rural interests dominated the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s. During this time, urban interests and African Americans were markedly under-represented. Following World War II, Alabama grew as the state\\'s economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests. The state\\'s economy in the 21st century is based on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.\\n\\nThe European-American naming of the Alabama River and state was derived from the Alabama people, a Muskogean-speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river. In the Alabama language, the word for a person of Alabama lineage is \"Albaamo\" (or variously \"Albaama\" or \"Albàamo\" in different dialects; the plural form is \"Albaamaha\"). The suggestion that \"Alabama\" was borrowed from the Choctaw language is unlikely. The word\\'s spelling varies significantly among historical sources. The first usage appears in three accounts of the Hernando de Soto expedition of 1540: Garcilaso de la Vega used \"Alibamo\", while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote \"Alibamu\" and \"Limamu\", respectively, in transliterations of the term. As early as 1702, the French called the tribe the \"Alibamon\", with French maps identifying the river as \"Rivière des Alibamons\". Other spellings of the name have included \"Alibamu\", \"Alabamo\", \"Albama\", \"Alebamon\", \"Alibama\", \"Alibamou\", \"Alabamu\", \"Allibamou\".\\n\\nSources disagree on the word\\'s meaning. Some scholars suggest the word comes from the Choctaw \"alba\" (meaning \"plants\" or \"weeds\") and \"amo\" (meaning \"to cut\", \"to trim\", or \"to gather\"). The meaning may have been \"clearers of the thicket\" or \"herb gatherers\", referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants. The state has numerous place names of Native American origin. However, there are no correspondingly similar words in the Alabama language.\\n\\nAn 1842 article in the \"Jacksonville Republican\" proposed it meant \"Here We Rest.\" This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of Alexander Beaufort Meek. Experts in the Muskogean languages have not found any evidence to support such a translation.\\n\\nIndigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of European colonization. Trade with the northeastern tribes by the Ohio River began during the Burial Mound Period (1000BCE700CE) and continued until European contact.\\n\\nThe agrarian Mississippian culture covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 CE, with one of its major centers built at what is now the Moundville Archaeological Site in Moundville, Alabama. This is the second-largest complex of the classic Middle Mississippian era, after Cahokia in present-day Illinois, which was the center of the culture. Analysis of artifacts from archaeological excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars\\' formulating the characteristics of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC). Contrary to popular belief, the SECC appears to have no direct links to Mesoamerican culture, but developed independently. The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples; it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood.\\n\\nAmong the historical tribes of Native American people living in present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were the Cherokee, an Iroquoian language people; and the Muskogean-speaking Alabama (\"Alibamu\"), Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Koasati. While part of the same large language family, the Muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages.\\n\\nWith exploration in the 16th century, the Spanish were the first Europeans to reach Alabama. The expedition of Hernando de Soto passed through Mabila and other parts of the state in 1540. More than 160 years later, the French founded the region\\'s first European settlement at Old Mobile in 1702. The city was moved to the current site of Mobile in 1711. This area was claimed by the French from 1702 to 1763 as part of La Louisiane.\\n\\nAfter the French lost to the British in the Seven Years\\' War, it became part of British West Florida from 1763 to 1783. After the United States victory in the American Revolutionary War, the territory was divided between the United States and Spain. The latter retained control of this western territory from 1783 until the surrender of the Spanish garrison at Mobile to U.S. forces on April 13, 1813.\\n\\nThomas Bassett, a loyalist to the British monarchy during the Revolutionary era, was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside Mobile. He settled in the Tombigbee District during the early 1770s. The district\\'s boundaries were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the Tombigbee River and included portions of what is today southern Clarke County, northernmost Mobile County, and most of Washington County.\\n\\nWhat is now the counties of Baldwin and Mobile became part of Spanish West Florida in 1783, part of the independent Republic of West Florida in 1810, and was finally added to the Mississippi Territory in 1812. Most of what is now the northern two-thirds of Alabama was known as the Yazoo lands beginning during the British colonial period. It was claimed by the Province of Georgia from 1767 onwards. Following the Revolutionary War, it remained a part of Georgia, although heavily disputed.\\n\\nWith the exception of the area around Mobile and the Yazoo lands, what is now the lower one-third of Alabama was made part of the Mississippi Territory when it was organized in 1798. The Yazoo lands were added to the territory in 1804, following the Yazoo land scandal. Spain kept a claim on its former Spanish West Florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the Adams–Onís Treaty officially ceded it to the United States in 1819.\\n\\nBefore Mississippi\\'s admission to statehood on December 10, 1817, the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the Alabama Territory. The United States Congress created the Alabama Territory on March 3, 1817. St. Stephens, now abandoned, served as the territorial capital from 1817 to 1819.\\n\\nAlabama was admitted as the 22nd state on December 14, 1819, with Congress selecting Huntsville as the site for the first Constitutional Convention. From July5 to August 2, 1819, delegates met to prepare the new state constitution. Huntsville served as temporary capital from 1819 to 1820, when the seat of government moved to Cahaba in Dallas County.\\n\\nCahaba, now a ghost town, was the first permanent state capital from 1820 to 1825. The Alabama Fever land rush was underway when the state was admitted to the Union, with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation. Part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s, its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men.\\nSoutheastern planters and traders from the Upper South brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in Alabama expanded. The economy of the central Black Belt (named for its dark, productive soil) was built around large cotton plantations whose owners\\' wealth grew mainly from slave labor. The area also drew many poor, disfranchised people who became subsistence farmers. Alabama had an estimated population of under 10,000 people in 1810, but it increased to more than 300,000 people by 1830. Most Native American tribes were completely removed from the state within a few years of the passage of the Indian Removal Act by Congress in 1830.\\n\\nFrom 1826 to 1846, Tuscaloosa served as Alabama\\'s capital. On January 30, 1846, the Alabama legislature announced it had voted to move the capital city from Tuscaloosa to Montgomery. The first legislative session in the new capital met in December 1847. A new capitol building was erected under the direction of Stephen Decatur Button of Philadelphia. The first structure burned down in 1849, but was rebuilt on the same site in 1851. This second capitol building in Montgomery remains to the present day. It was designed by Barachias Holt of Exeter, Maine.\\n\\nBy 1860, the population had increased to 964,201 people, of which nearly half, 435,080, were enslaved African Americans, and 2,690 were free people of color. On January 11, 1861, Alabama declared its secession from the Union. After remaining an independent republic for a few days, it joined the Confederate States of America. The Confederacy\\'s capital was initially at Montgomery. Alabama was heavily involved in the American Civil War. Although comparatively few battles were fought in the state, Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the war effort.\\nA company of cavalry soldiers from Huntsville, Alabama, joined Nathan Bedford Forrest\\'s battalion in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. The company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves, collar and coat tails. This led to them being greeted with \"Yellowhammer\", and the name later was applied to all Alabama troops in the Confederate Army.\\n\\nAlabama\\'s slaves were freed by the 13th Amendment in 1865. Alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in May 1865 until its official restoration to the Union in 1868. From 1867 to 1874, with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised, many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state. Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African-American congressmen: Jeremiah Haralson, Benjamin S. Turner, and James T. Rapier.\\n\\nFollowing the war, the state remained chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton. During Reconstruction, state legislators ratified a new state constitution in 1868 which created the state\\'s first public school system and expanded women\\'s rights. Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects, although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation. Organized insurgent, resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans. Besides the short-lived original Ku Klux Klan, these included the Pale Faces, Knights of the White Camellia, Red Shirts, and the White League.\\n\\nReconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874, when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governor\\'s office through an election dominated by fraud and violence. They wrote another constitution in 1875, and the legislature passed the Blaine Amendment, prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious-affiliated schools. The same year, legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools. Railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891. After disenfranchising most African Americans and many poor whites in the 1901 constitution, the Alabama legislature passed more Jim Crow laws at the beginning of the 20th century to impose segregation in everyday life.\\n\\nThe new 1901 Constitution of Alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population, including nearly all African Americans and Native Americans, and tens of thousands of poor whites, through making voter registration difficult, requiring a poll tax and literacy test. The 1901 constitution required racial segregation of public schools. By 1903, only 2,980 African Americans were registered in Alabama, although at least 74,000 were literate. This compared to more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote in 1900. The numbers dropped even more in later decades. The state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the 1950s: jails were segregated in 1911; hospitals in 1915; toilets, hotels, and restaurants in 1928; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945.\\n\\nWhile the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting, the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well, due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax. By 1941, whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws: 600,000 whites vs. 520,000 African-Americans. Nearly all African Americans had lost the ability to vote. Despite numerous legal challenges which succeeded in overturning certain provisions, the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement. The exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens.\\n\\nThe rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised African Americans, but it did not relieve them of paying taxes. Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South, the Rosenwald Fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as Rosenwald Schools. In Alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds, which paid one-third of the construction costs. The fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest. Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice, by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools, which were built in many rural areas. They often donated land and labor as well.\\nBeginning in 1913, the first 80 Rosenwald Schools were built in Alabama for African-American children. A total of 387 schools, seven teachers\\' houses, and several vocational buildings were completed by 1937 in the state. Several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\\n\\nContinued racial discrimination and lynchings, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans from rural Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the Great Migration out of the South. Reflecting this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see \"historical populations\" table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920.\\n\\nAt the same time, many rural people migrated to the city of Birmingham to work in new industrial jobs. Birmingham experienced such rapid growth it was called the \"Magic City\". By 1920, Birmingham was the 36th-largest city in the United States. Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy. Its residents were under-represented for decades in the state legislature, which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes, as it was required by the state constitution. This did not change until the late 1960s following a lawsuit and court order.\\nIndustrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war. Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living. One example of this massive influx of workers occurred in Mobile. Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into the city to work for war-related industries. Cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base.\\n\\nDespite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population, as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. One result was that Jefferson County, containing Birmingham\\'s industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services. Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, \"a minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature.\"\\n\\nIn the United States Supreme Court cases of \"Baker v. Carr\" (1962) and \"Reynolds v. Sims\" (1964), the court ruled that the principle of \"one man, one vote\" needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures, and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties.\\n\\nIn 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census. This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than sixty years. Other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts.\\n\\nAfrican Americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement, including legal challenges. In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in \"Brown v. Board of Education\" that public schools had to be desegregated, but Alabama was slow to comply. During the 1960s, under Governor George Wallace, Alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation. The civil rights movement had notable events in Alabama, including the Montgomery Bus Boycott (1955–56), Freedom Rides in 1961, and 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches. These contributed to Congressional passage and enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 by the U.S. Congress.\\n\\nLegal segregation ended in the states in 1964, but Jim Crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court. According to \"The New York Times\", by 2017, many of Alabama\\'s African-Americans were living in Alabama\\'s cities such as Birmingham and Montgomery. Also, the Black Belt region across central Alabama \"is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly African-American. These counties include Dallas, Lowndes, Marengo and Perry.\"\\n\\nAlabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation. In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, \"Dillard v. Crenshaw County\", challenged the at-large voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards. At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.\\n\\nAs part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including Chilton County, adopted a system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in Conecuh County. In 1982, limited voting was first tested in Conecuh County. Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.\\n\\nAlabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with of total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making Alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the United States. About three-fifths of the land area is a gentle plain with a general descent towards the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. The North Alabama region is mostly mountainous, with the Tennessee River cutting a large valley and creating numerous creeks, streams, rivers, mountains, and lakes.\\n\\nAlabama is bordered by the states of Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama has coastline at the Gulf of Mexico, in the extreme southern edge of the state. The state ranges in elevation from sea level at Mobile Bay to nearly half a mile in the northeast, to wit Mount Cheaha at .\\n\\nAlabama\\'s land consists of of forest or 67% of total land area. Suburban Baldwin County, along the Gulf Coast, is the largest county in the state in both land area and water area.\\nAreas in Alabama administered by the National Park Service include Horseshoe Bend National Military Park near Alexander City; Little River Canyon National Preserve near Fort Payne; Russell Cave National Monument in Bridgeport; Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site in Tuskegee; and Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site near Tuskegee. Additionally, Alabama has four National Forests: Conecuh, Talladega, Tuskegee, and William B. Bankhead. Alabama also contains the Natchez Trace Parkway, the Selma To Montgomery National Historic Trail, and the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail.\\n\\nNotable natural wonders include: the \"Natural Bridge\" rock, the longest natural bridge east of the Rockies, located just south of Haleyville; Cathedral Caverns in Marshall County, named for its cathedral-like appearance, features one of the largest cave entrances and stalagmites in the world; Ecor Rouge in Fairhope, the highest coastline point between Maine and Mexico; DeSoto Caverns in Childersburg, the first officially recorded cave in the United States; Noccalula Falls in Gadsden features a 90-foot waterfall; Dismals Canyon near Phil Campbell, home to two waterfalls, six\\xa0natural bridges and allegedly served as a hideout for legendary outlaw Jesse James; Stephens Gap Cave in Jackson County boasts a 143-foot pit, two waterfalls and is one of the most photographed wild cave scenes in America; Little River Canyon near Fort Payne, one of the nation\\'s longest mountaintop rivers; Rickwood Caverns near Warrior features an underground pool, blind cave fish and 260 million year old limestone formations; and the Walls of Jericho canyon on the Alabama-Tennessee state line.\\n\\nA -wide meteorite impact crater is located in Elmore County, just north of Montgomery. This is the Wetumpka crater, the site of \"Alabama\\'s greatest natural disaster\". A -wide meteorite hit the area about 80 million years ago. The hills just east of downtown Wetumpka showcase the eroded remains of the impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock, with the area labeled the Wetumpka crater or astrobleme (\"star-wound\") because of the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock that can be found beneath the surface. In 2002, Christian Koeberl with the Institute of Geochemistry University of Vienna published evidence and established the site as the 157th recognized impact crater on Earth.\\nThe state is classified as humid subtropical (\"Cfa\") under the Koppen Climate Classification. The average annual temperature is 64\\xa0°F (18\\xa0°C). Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, while the northern parts of the state, especially in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast, tend to be slightly cooler. Generally, Alabama has very hot summers and mild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year. Alabama receives an average of of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300 days in the southern part of the state.\\n\\nSummers in Alabama are among the hottest in the U.S., with high temperatures averaging over throughout the summer in some parts of the state. Alabama is also prone to tropical storms and even hurricanes. Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken.\\n\\nSouth Alabama reports many thunderstorms. The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported. This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60 days per year. Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent lightning and large hail; the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm. Alabama ranks ninth in the number of deaths from lightning and tenth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita.\\nAlabama, along with Oklahoma and Iowa, has the most confirmed F5 and EF5 tornadoes of any state, according to statistics from the National Climatic Data Center for the period January 1, 1950, to June 2013. Several long-tracked F5/EF5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities since 1950 than any other state. The state was affected by the 1974 Super Outbreak and was devastated tremendously by the 2011 Super Outbreak. The 2011 Super Outbreak produced a record amount of tornadoes in the state. The tally reached 62.\\n\\nThe peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state. Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December besides the typically severe spring. The northern part—along the Tennessee River Valley—is most vulnerable. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as Dixie Alley, as distinct from the Tornado Alley of the Southern Plains.\\n\\nWinters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the Southeastern United States, with average January low temperatures around in Mobile and around in Birmingham. Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years. Historic snowfall events include New Year\\'s Eve 1963 snowstorm and the 1993 Storm of the Century. The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is per year. In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall.\\n\\nAlabama\\'s highest temperature of was recorded on September 5, 1925, in the unincorporated community of Centerville. The record low of occurred on January 30, 1966, in New Market.\\n\\nAlabama is home to a diverse array of flora and fauna in habitats that range from the Tennessee Valley, Appalachian Plateau, and Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians of the north to the Piedmont, Canebrake, and Black Belt of the central region to the Gulf Coastal Plain and beaches along the Gulf of Mexico in the south. The state is usually ranked among the top in nation for its range of overall biodiversity.\\n\\nAlabama is in the subtropical coniferous forest biome and once boasted huge expanses of pine forest, which still form the largest proportion of forests in the state. It currently ranks fifth in the nation for the diversity of its flora. It is home to nearly 4,000 pteridophyte and spermatophyte plant species.\\n\\nIndigenous animal species in the state include 62 mammal species, 93 reptile species, 73 amphibian species, roughly 307 native freshwater fish species, and 420 bird species that spend at least part of their year within the state. Invertebrates include 97 crayfish species and 383 mollusk species. 113 of these mollusk species have never been collected outside the state.\\n\\nThe United States Census Bureau estimates the population of Alabama was 4,903,185 on July 1, 2019, which represents an increase of 123,440 or 2.58%, since the 2010 Census. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 121,054 (502,457 births minus 381,403 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 104,991 into the state.\\n\\nImmigration from outside the U.S. resulted in a net increase of 31,180 people, and migration within the country produced a net gain of 73,811 people. The state had 108,000 foreign-born (2.4% of the state population), of which an estimated 22.2% were undocumented (24,000).\\n\\nThe center of population of Alabama is located in Chilton County, outside the town of Jemison.\\n\\nAccording to the 2010 Census, Alabama had a population of 4,779,736. The racial composition of the state was 68.5% White (67.0% Non-Hispanic White and 1.5% Hispanic White), 26.2% Black or African American, 3.9% Hispanic or Latino of any race, 1.1% Asian, 0.6% American Indian and Alaska Native, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 2.0% from Some Other Race, and 1.5% from Two or More Races. In 2011, 46.6% of Alabama\\'s population younger than age1 were minorities.\\n\\nThe largest reported ancestry groups in Alabama are: African (26.2%), English (23.6%), Irish (7.7%), German (5.7%), and Scots-Irish (2.0%). Those citing \"American\" ancestry in Alabama are generally of English or British ancestry; many Anglo-Americans identify as having American ancestry because their roots have been in North America for so long, in some cases since the 1600s. Demographers estimate that 20–23% of people in Alabama are of predominantly English ancestry and the figure is likely higher. In the 1980 census, 41% of the people in Alabama identified as being of English ancestry, making them the largest ethnic group at the time.\\n\\nBased on historic migration and settlement patterns in the southern colonies and states, demographers estimated there are more people in Alabama of Scots-Irish origins than self-reported. Many people in Alabama claim Irish ancestry because of the term Scots-Irish but, based on historic immigration and settlement, their ancestors were more likely Protestant Scots-Irish coming from northern Ireland, where they had been for a few generations as part of the English colonization. The Scots-Irish were the largest non-English immigrant group from the British Isles before the American Revolution, and many settled in the South, later moving into the Deep South as it was developed.\\n\\nIn 1984, under the Davis–Strong Act, the state legislature established the Alabama Indian Affairs Commission. Native American groups within the state had increasingly been demanding recognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination. Given the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation, the Native American peoples, who have sometimes been of mixed race, have insisted on having their cultural identification respected. In the past, their self-identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black.\\n\\nThe state has officially recognized nine American Indian tribes in the state, descended mostly from the Five Civilized Tribes of the American Southeast. These are the following.\\n\\nThe state government has promoted recognition of Native American contributions to the state, including the designation in 2000 for Columbus Day to be jointly celebrated as American Indian Heritage Day.\\n\\nMost Alabama residents (95.1% of those five and older) spoke only English at home in 2010, a minor decrease from 96.1% in 2000. Alabama English is predominantly Southern, and is related to South Midland speech which was taken across the border from Tennessee. In the major Southern speech region, there is the decreasing loss of the final /r/, for example the /boyd/ pronunciation of \\'bird\\'. In the northern third of the state, there is a South Midland \\'arm\\' and \\'barb\\' rhyming with \\'form\\' and \\'orb\\'. Unique words in Alabama English include: redworm (earthworm), peckerwood (woodpecker), snake doctor and snake feeder (dragonfly), tow sack (burlap bag), plum peach (clingstone), French harp (harmonica), and dog irons (andirons).\\n\\nIn the 2008 American Religious Identification Survey, 86% of Alabama respondents reported their religion as Christian, including 6% Catholic, with 11% as having no religion. The composition of other traditions is 0.5% Mormon, 0.5% Jewish, 0.5% Muslim, 0.5% Buddhist, and 0.5% Hindu.\\n\\nAlabama is located in the middle of the Bible Belt, a region of numerous Protestant Christians. Alabama has been identified as one of the most religious states in the United States, with about 58% of the population attending church regularly. A majority of people in the state identify as Evangelical Protestant. , the three largest denominational groups in Alabama are the Southern Baptist Convention, The United Methodist Church, and non-denominational Evangelical Protestant.\\n\\nIn Alabama, the Southern Baptist Convention has the highest number of adherents with 1,380,121; this is followed by the United Methodist Church with 327,734 adherents, non-denominational Evangelical Protestant with 220,938 adherents, and the Catholic Church with 150,647 adherents. Many Baptist and Methodist congregations became established in the Great Awakening of the early 19th century, when preachers proselytized across the South. The Assemblies of God had almost 60,000 members, the Churches of Christ had nearly 120,000 members. The Presbyterian churches, strongly associated with Scots-Irish immigrants of the 18th century and their descendants, had a combined membership around 75,000 (PCA—28,009 members in 108 congregations, PC(USA)—26,247 members in 147 congregations, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church—6,000 members in 59 congregations, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America—5,000 members and fifty congregations plus the EPC and Associate Reformed Presbyterians with 230 members and nine congregations).\\n\\nIn a 2007 survey, nearly 70% of respondents could name all four of the Christian Gospels. Of those who indicated a religious preference, 59% said they possessed a \"full understanding\" of their faith and needed no further learning. In a 2007 poll, 92% of Alabamians reported having at least some confidence in churches in the state.\\n\\nAlthough in much smaller numbers, many other religious faiths are represented in the state as well, including Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, the Bahá\\'í Faith, and Unitarian Universalism.\\n\\nJews have been present in what is now Alabama since 1763, during the colonial era of Mobile, when Sephardic Jews immigrated from London. The oldest Jewish congregation in the state is Congregation Sha\\'arai Shomayim in Mobile. It was formally recognized by the state legislature on January 25, 1844. Later immigrants in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries tended to be Ashkenazi Jews from eastern Europe. Jewish denominations in the state include two Orthodox, four Conservative, ten Reform, and one Humanistic synagogue.\\n\\nMuslims have been increasing in Alabama, with 31 mosques built by 2011, many by African-American converts.\\n\\nSeveral Hindu temples and cultural centers in the state have been founded by Indian immigrants and their descendants, the best-known being the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in Birmingham, the Hindu Temple and Cultural Center of Birmingham in Pelham, the Hindu Cultural Center of North Alabama in Capshaw, and the Hindu Mandir and Cultural Center in Tuscaloosa.\\n\\nThere are six Dharma centers and organizations for Theravada Buddhists. Most monastic Buddhist temples are concentrated in southern Mobile County, near Bayou La Batre. This area has attracted an influx of refugees from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam during the 1970s and thereafter. The four temples within a ten-mile radius of Bayou La Batre, include Chua Chanh Giac, Wat Buddharaksa, and Wat Lao Phoutthavihan.\\n\\nThe first community of adherents of the Bahá\\'í Faith in Alabama was founded in 1896 by Paul K. Dealy, who moved from Chicago to Fairhope. Bahá\\'í centers in Alabama exist in Birmingham, Huntsville, and Florence.\\n\\nA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study in 2008 showed that obesity in Alabama is a problem, with most counties having more than 29% of adults obese, except for ten which had a rate between 26% and 29%. Residents of the state, along with those in five other states, were least likely in the nation to be physically active during leisure time. Alabama, and the southeastern U.S. in general, has one of the highest incidences of adult onset diabetes in the country, exceeding 10% of adults.\\n\\nOn May 14, 2019, Alabama passed the Human Life Protection Act, banning abortion at any stage of pregnancy unless there is a \"serious health risk\", with no exceptions for rape and incest. The law, if enacted, would punish doctors who perform abortions with 10 to 99 years imprisonment and be the most restrictive abortion law in the country. However, on October 29, 2019, U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson blocked the law from taking effect.\\n\\nThe state has invested in aerospace, education, health care, banking, and various heavy industries, including automobile manufacturing, mineral extraction, steel production and fabrication. By 2006, crop and animal production in Alabama was valued at $1.5 billion. In contrast to the primarily agricultural economy of the previous century, this was only about 1% of the state\\'s gross domestic product. The number of private farms has declined at a steady rate since the 1960s, as land has been sold to developers, timber companies, and large farming conglomerates.\\n\\nNon-agricultural employment in 2008 was 121,800 in management occupations; 71,750 in business and financial operations; 36,790 in computer-related and mathematical occupation; 44,200 in architecture and engineering; 12,410 in life, physical, and social sciences; 32,260 in community and social services; 12,770 in legal occupations; 116,250 in education, training, and library services; 27,840 in art, design and media occupations; 121,110 in healthcare; 44,750 in fire fighting, law enforcement, and security; 154,040 in food preparation and serving; 76,650 in building and grounds cleaning and maintenance; 53,230 in personal care and services; 244,510 in sales; 338,760 in office and administration support; 20,510 in farming, fishing, and forestry; 120,155 in construction and mining, gas, and oil extraction; 106,280 in installation, maintenance, and repair; 224,110 in production; and 167,160 in transportation and material moving.\\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the 2008 total gross state product was $170 billion, or $29,411 per capita. Alabama\\'s 2012 GDP increased 1.2% from the previous year. The single largest increase came in the area of information. In 2010, per capita income for the state was $22,984.\\n\\nThe state\\'s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 5.8% in April 2015. This compared to a nationwide seasonally adjusted rate of 5.4%.\\n\\nAlabama has no minimum wage and in February 2016 passed legislation preventing municipalities from setting one. (A Birmingham city ordinance would have raised theirs to $10.10.)\\n\\n, Alabama has the sixth highest poverty rate among states in the U.S. In 2017, United Nations Special Rapporteur Philip Alston toured parts of rural Alabama and observed environmental conditions he said were poorer than anywhere he had seen in the developed world.\\n\\nThe five employers that employed the most employees in Alabama in April 2011 were:\\nThe next twenty largest employers, , included:\\nAlabama\\'s agricultural outputs include poultry and eggs, cattle, fish, plant nursery items, peanuts, cotton, grains such as corn and sorghum, vegetables, milk, soybeans, and peaches. Although known as \"The Cotton State\", Alabama ranks between eighth and tenth in national cotton production, according to various reports, with Texas, Georgia and Mississippi comprising the top three.\\n\\nAlabama\\'s industrial outputs include iron and steel products (including cast-iron and steel pipe); paper, lumber, and wood products; mining (mostly coal); plastic products; cars and trucks; and apparel. In addition, Alabama produces aerospace and electronic products, mostly in the Huntsville area, the location of NASA\\'s George C. Marshall Space Flight Center and the U.S. Army Materiel Command, headquartered at Redstone Arsenal.\\nA great deal of Alabama\\'s economic growth since the 1990s has been due to the state\\'s expanding automotive manufacturing industry. Located in the state are Honda Manufacturing of Alabama, Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama, Mercedes-Benz U.S. International, and Toyota Motor Manufacturing Alabama, as well as their various suppliers. Since 1993, the automobile industry has generated more than 67,800 new jobs in the state. Alabama currently ranks 4th in the nation for vehicle exports.\\n\\nAutomakers accounted for approximately a third of the industrial expansion in the state in 2012. The eight models produced at the state\\'s auto factories totaled combined sales of 74,335 vehicles for 2012. The strongest model sales during this period were the Hyundai Elantra compact car, the Mercedes-Benz GL-Class sport utility vehicle and the Honda Ridgeline sport utility truck.\\nSteel producers Outokumpu, Nucor, SSAB, ThyssenKrupp, and U.S. Steel have facilities in Alabama and employ more than 10,000 people. In May 2007, German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp selected Calvert in Mobile County for a 4.65 billion combined stainless and carbon steel processing facility. ThyssenKrupp\\'s stainless steel division, Inoxum, including the stainless portion of the Calvert plant, was sold to Finnish stainless steel company Outokumpu in 2012. The remaining portion of the ThyssenKrupp plant had final bids submitted by ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel for $1.6 billion in March 2013. Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional submitted a combined bid for the mill at Calvert, plus a majority stake in the ThyssenKrupp mill in Brazil, for $3.8 billion. In July 2013, the plant was sold to ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel.\\n\\nThe Hunt Refining Company, a subsidiary of Hunt Consolidated, Inc., is based in Tuscaloosa and operates a refinery there. The company also operates terminals in Mobile, Melvin, and Moundville. JVC America, Inc. operates an optical disc replication and packaging plant in Tuscaloosa.\\n\\nThe Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company operates a large plant in Gadsden which employs about 1,400 people. It has been in operation since 1929.\\n\\nConstruction of an Airbus A320 family aircraft assembly plant in Mobile was formally announced by Airbus CEO Fabrice Brégier from the Mobile Convention Center on July 2, 2012. The plans include a $600 million factory at the Brookley Aeroplex for the assembly of the A319, A320 and A321 aircraft. Construction began in 2013, with plans for it to become operable by 2015 and produce up to 50 aircraft per year by 2017. The assembly plant is the company\\'s first factory to be built within the United States. It was announced on February 1, 2013, that Airbus had hired Alabama-based Hoar Construction to oversee construction of the facility.\\n\\nAccording to Business Insider, Alabama ranked 14th in most popular states to visit in 2014. An estimated 26 million tourists visited the state in 2018, more than 100,000 of them from other countries including Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan. In 2006, 22.3 million travellers spent $8.3 billion providing an estimated 162,000 jobs in the state.\\n\\nThe state is home to various attractions, natural features, parks and events that attract visitors from around the globe, notably the annual Hangout Music Festival, held on the public beaches of Gulf Shores; the Alabama Shakespeare Festival, one of the ten largest Shakespeare festivals in the world; the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail, a collection of championship caliber golf courses distributed across the state; casinos such as Victoryland; amusement parks such as Alabama Splash Adventure; the Riverchase Galleria, one of the largest shopping centers in the southeast; Guntersville Lake, voted the best lake in Alabama by Southern Living Magazine readers; and the Alabama Museum of Natural History, the oldest museum in the state.\\nMobile is known for having the oldest organized Mardi Gras celebration in the United States, beginning in 1703. It was also host to the first formally organized Mardi Gras parade in the United States in 1830, a tradition that continues to this day. Mardi Gras is an official state holiday in Mobile and Baldwin counties.\\n\\nIn 2018, Mobile\\'s Mardi Gras parade was the state\\'s top event, producing the most tourists with an attendance of 892,811. The top attraction was the U.S. Space & Rocket Center in Huntsville with an attendance of 849,981, followed by the Birmingham Zoo with 543,090. Of the parks and natural destinations, Alabama\\'s Gulf Coast topped the list with 6,700,000 visitors.\\n\\nAlabama has historically been a popular region for film shoots due to its diverse landscapes and contrast of environments. Movies filmed in Alabama include: Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Get Out, 42, Selma, Big Fish, The Final Destination, Due Date, Need For Speed and many more.\\n\\nUAB Hospital is the only Level I trauma center in Alabama. UAB is the largest state government employer in Alabama, with a workforce of about 18,000. A 2017 study found that Alabama had the least competitive health insurance market in the country, with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama having a market share of 84% followed by UnitedHealth Group at 7%.\\n\\nRegions Financial Corporation and BBVA USA Bank are the largest banks headquartered in Alabama. Birmingham-based Compass Banchshares was acquired by Spanish-based BBVA in September 2007 with the headquarters of BBVA USA remaining in Birmingham. In November 2006, Regions Financial acquired AmSouth Bancorporation, which was also headquartered in Birmingham. SouthTrust Corporation, another large bank headquartered in Birmingham, was acquired by Wachovia in 2004.\\n\\nWells Fargo has a regional headquarters, an operations center campus, and a $400 million data center in Birmingham. Many smaller banks are also headquartered in the Birmingham area, including ServisFirst and New South Federal Savings Bank. Birmingham also serves as the headquarters for several large investment management companies, including Harbert Management Corporation.\\n\\nTelecommunications provider AT&T, formerly BellSouth, has a major presence in Alabama with several large offices in Birmingham.\\n\\nMany commercial technology companies are headquartered in Huntsville, such as network access company ADTRAN, computer graphics company Intergraph, and IT infrastructure company Avocent.\\n\\nRust International has grown to include Brasfield & Gorrie, BE&K, Hoar Construction, and B.L. Harbert International, which all routinely are included in the Engineering News-Record lists of top design, international construction, and engineering firms. (Rust International was acquired in 2000 by Washington Group International, which was in turn acquired by San-Francisco based URS Corporation in 2007.)\\n\\nThe foundational document for Alabama\\'s government is the Alabama Constitution, which was ratified in 1901. At almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is by some accounts the world\\'s longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the United States Constitution.\\n\\nThere has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama\\'s constitution. Critics argue that Alabama\\'s constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature, leaving practically no power in local hands. Most counties do not have home rule. Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.\\nAlabama\\'s government is divided into three coequal branches. The legislative branch is the Alabama Legislature, a bicameral assembly composed of the Alabama House of Representatives, with 105 members, and the Alabama Senate, with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The Republican Party currently holds a majority in both houses of the Legislature. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).\\n\\nUntil 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In \"Reynolds v. Sims\" (1964), the U.S. Supreme Court implemented the principle of \"one man, one vote\", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.\\n\\nAt that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.\\nThe executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the governor of Alabama. Other members of executive branch include the cabinet, the lieutenant governor of Alabama, the Attorney General of Alabama, the Alabama Secretary of State, the Alabama State Treasurer, and the State Auditor of Alabama. The current governor is Republican Kay Ivey.\\n\\nThe members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections. Statewide officials, such as the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and other constitutional officers, take office the following January.\\n\\nThe judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the state\\'s Constitution and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The state\\'s highest court is the Supreme Court of Alabama. Alabama uses partisan elections to select judges. Since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized. The current chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican Tom Parker. All sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme Court are members of the Republican Party. There are two intermediate appellate courts, the Court of Civil Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals, and four trial courts: the circuit court (trial court of general jurisdiction), and the district, probate, and municipal courts.\\n\\nSome critics believe the election of judges has contributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions. Alabama has the highest per capita death penalty rate in the country. In some years, it imposes more death sentences than does Texas, a state which has a population five times larger. However, executions per capita are significantly higher in Texas. Some of its cases have been highly controversial; the Supreme Court has overturned 24 convictions in death penalty cases. It was the only state to allow judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use a death sentence; in 10 cases judges overturned sentences of life imprisonment without parole (LWOP) that were voted unanimously by juries. This judicial authority was removed in April 2017.\\n\\nTaxes are collected by the Alabama Department of Revenue. Alabama levies a 2, 4, or5 percent personal income tax, depending on the amount earned and filing status. Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their Alabama state tax, even if taking the standard deduction; those who itemize can also deduct FICA (the Social Security and Medicare tax).\\n\\nThe state\\'s general sales tax rate is 4%. Sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases. For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means a diner in Mobile would pay an 11% tax on a meal. , sales and excise taxes in Alabama account for 51% of all state and local revenue, compared with an average of about 36% nationwide. Alabama is one of seven states that levy a tax on food at the same rate as other goods, and one of two states (the other being neighboring Mississippi) which fully taxes groceries without any offsetting relief for low-income families. (Most states exempt groceries from sales tax or apply a lower tax rate.)\\n\\nAlabama\\'s income tax on poor working families is among the highest in the U.S. Alabama is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as $4,600, which is barely one-quarter the federal poverty line. Alabama\\'s threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the District of Columbia with income taxes.\\n\\nThe corporate income tax rate is currently 6.5%. The overall federal, state, and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country. Property taxes are the lowest in the U.S. The current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes.\\n\\nSince Alabama\\'s tax structure largely depends on consumer spending, it is subject to high variable budget structure. For example, in 2003, Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $670 million.\\n\\nAlabama has 67 counties. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of the constraints of the Alabama Constitution, which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited home rule. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning.\\n\\nThe state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission. Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in \"Baker v. Carr\" (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, in order to implement the principle of \"one man, one vote\". Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.\\n\\n\"The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama\\'s constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.\"\\n\\nAlabama is an alcoholic beverage control state, meaning the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. The Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state. Twenty-five of the 67 counties are \"dry counties\" which ban the sale of alcohol, and there are many dry municipalities even in counties which permit alcohol sales.\\n\\nDuring Reconstruction following the American Civil War, Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the Third Military District under General John Pope. In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the Redeemers took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation.\\n\\nAfter 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.\\n\\nFrom 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.\\n\\nAlabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement, when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Governor George Wallace, the state\\'s only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by at-large electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish single-member districts that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.\\n\\nIn 2007, the Alabama Legislature passed, and Republican governor Bob Riley signed a resolution expressing \"profound regret\" over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the Alabama State Capitol, which housed Congress of the Confederate States of America.\\n\\nIn 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.\\n\\n, there are a total of 3,326,812 registered voters, with 2,979,576 active, and the others inactive in the state.\\n\\nWith the disfranchisement of Blacks in 1901, the state became part of the \"Solid South\", a system in which the Democratic Party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state. For nearly a hundred years local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party primary, with generally only token Republican challengers running in the General Election. Since the mid- to late 20th century, however, white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party. In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office.\\n\\nMembers of the nine seats on the Supreme Court of Alabama and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. In that general election, the then-incumbent chief justice, Ernest C. Hornsby, refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican Perry O. Hooper, Sr.. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.\\n\\nIn the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the Alabama State Board of Education. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission was defeated in 2012.\\n\\nOnly three Republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise. The three GOP lieutenant governors are Steve Windom (1999–2003), Kay Ivey (2011–2017), and Will Ainsworth (2019–present).\\n\\nMany local offices (county commissioners, boards of education, tax assessors, tax collectors, etc.) in the state are still held by Democrats. Many rural counties have voters who are majority Democrats, resulting in local elections being decided in the Democratic primary. Similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority-Republican and elections are effectively decided in the Republican Primary, although there are exceptions.\\n\\nAlabama\\'s 67 county sheriffs are elected in partisan, at-large races, and Democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts. The current split is 35 Democrats, 31 Republicans, and one Independent Fayette. However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties. The majority of Republican sheriffs have been elected in the more urban/suburban and heavily populated counties. , the state of Alabama has one female sheriff, in Morgan County, Alabama, and ten African-American sheriffs.\\n\\nThe state\\'s two U.S. senators are Republican Richard C. Shelby and Democrat Doug Jones. Shelby was originally elected to the Senate as a Democrat in 1986 and re-elected in 1992, but switched parties immediately following the November 1994 general election.\\n\\nIn the U.S. House of Representatives, the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are Republicans: (Bradley Byrne, Mike D. Rogers, Robert Aderholt, Morris J. Brooks, Martha Roby, and Gary Palmer) and one Democrat: Terri Sewell who represents the Black Belt as well as most of the predominantly black portions of Birmingham, Tuscaloosa and Montgomery.\\n\\nPublic primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the purview of the Alabama State Board of Education as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. Together, 1,496 individual schools provide education for 744,637 elementary and secondary students.\\n\\nPublic school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 2006–2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year. In 2007, more than 82 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National No Child Left Behind law, using measures determined by the state of Alabama.\\n\\nWhile Alabama\\'s public education system has improved in recent decades, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. According to U.S. Census data (2000), Alabama\\'s high school graduation rate (75%) is the fourth lowest in the U.S. (after Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi). The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.\\n\\nGenerally prohibited in the West at large, school corporal punishment is not unusual in Alabama, with 27,260 public school students paddled at least one time, according to government data for the 2011–2012 school year. The rate of school corporal punishment in Alabama is surpassed only by Mississippi and Arkansas.\\n\\nAlabama\\'s programs of higher education include 14 four-year public universities, two-year community colleges, and 17 private, undergraduate and graduate universities. In the state are four medical schools (as of fall 2015) (University of Alabama School of Medicine, University of South Alabama and Alabama College of Osteopathic Medicine and The Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine—Auburn Campus), two veterinary colleges (Auburn University and Tuskegee University), a dental school (University of Alabama School of Dentistry), an optometry college (University of Alabama at Birmingham), two pharmacy schools (Auburn University and Samford University), and five law schools (University of Alabama School of Law, Birmingham School of Law, Cumberland School of Law, Miles Law School, and the Thomas Goode Jones School of Law). Public, post-secondary education in Alabama is overseen by the Alabama Commission on Higher Education and the Alabama Department of Postsecondary Education. Colleges and universities in Alabama offer degree programs from two-year associate degrees to a multitude of doctoral level programs.\\nThe largest single campus is the University of Alabama, located in Tuscaloosa, with 37,665 enrolled for fall 2016. Troy University was the largest institution in the state in 2010, with an enrollment of 29,689 students across four Alabama campuses (Troy, Dothan, Montgomery, and Phenix City), as well as sixty learning sites in seventeen other states and eleven other countries. The oldest institutions are the public University of North Alabama in Florence and the Catholic Church-affiliated Spring Hill College in Mobile, both founded in 1830.\\n\\nAccreditation of academic programs is through the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) as well as other subject-focused national and international accreditation agencies such as the Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE), the Council on Occupational Education (COE), and the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS).\\n\\nAccording to the 2011 \"U.S. News & World Report\", Alabama had three universities ranked in the top 100 Public Schools in America (University of Alabama at 31, Auburn University at 36, and University of Alabama at Birmingham at 73).\\n\\nAccording to the 2012 \"U.S. News & World Report\", Alabama had four tier one universities (University of Alabama, Auburn University, University of Alabama at Birmingham and University of Alabama in Huntsville).\\n\\nMajor newspapers include \"Birmingham News\", Mobile \"Press-Register\", and \"Montgomery Advertiser\".\\n\\nMajor television network affiliates in Alabama include:\\n\\nCollege football is extremely popular in Alabama, particularly the University of Alabama Crimson Tide and Auburn University Tigers, rivals in the Southeastern Conference. In the 2013 season, Alabama averaged over 100,000 fans per game and Auburn averaged over 80,000 fans, both numbers among the top 20 in the nation. Bryant–Denny Stadium is the home of the Alabama football team, and has a seating capacity of 101,821, and is the fifth largest stadium in America. Jordan-Hare Stadium is the home field of the Auburn football team and seats up to 87,451.\\n\\nLegion Field is home for the UAB Blazers football program and the Birmingham Bowl. It seats 71,594. Ladd–Peebles Stadium in Mobile is the home of the University of South Alabama football team, and serves as the home of the NCAA Senior Bowl, Dollar General Bowl (formerly GoDaddy.com Bowl), and Alabama-Mississippi All Star Classic; the stadium seats 40,646. In 2009, Bryant–Denny Stadium and Jordan-Hare Stadium became the homes of the Alabama High School Athletic Association state football championship games, after previously being held at Legion Field in Birmingham.\\n\\nAlabama has several professional and semi-professional sports teams, including three minor league baseball teams.\\nThe Talladega Superspeedway motorsports complex hosts a series of NASCAR events. It has a seating capacity of 143,000 and is the thirteenth largest stadium in the world and sixth largest stadium in America. Also, the Barber Motorsports Park has hosted IndyCar Series and Rolex Sports Car Series races.\\n\\nThe ATP Birmingham was a World Championship Tennis tournament held from 1973 to 1980.\\n\\nAlabama has hosted several professional golf tournaments, such as the 1984 and 1990 PGA Championship at Shoal Creek, the Barbasol Championship (PGA Tour), the Mobile LPGA Tournament of Champions, Airbus LPGA Classic, and Yokohama Tire LPGA Classic (LPGA Tour), and The Tradition (Champions Tour).\\n\\nMajor airports with sustained operations in Alabama include Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport (BHM), Huntsville International Airport (HSV), Dothan Regional Airport (DHN), Mobile Regional Airport (MOB), Montgomery Regional Airport (MGM), Northwest Alabama Regional Airport (MSL) and Northeast Alabama Regional Airport (GAD).\\n\\nFor rail transport, Amtrak schedules the \"Crescent\", a daily passenger train, running from New York to New Orleans with station stops at Anniston, Birmingham, and Tuscaloosa.\\n\\nAlabama has six major interstate routes: Interstate 65 (I-65) travels north–south roughly through the middle of the state; I-20/I-59 travel from the central west Mississippi state line to Birmingham, where I-59 continues to the north-east corner of the state and I-20 continues east towards Atlanta; I-85 originates in Montgomery and travels east-northeast to the Georgia state line, providing a main thoroughfare to Atlanta; and I-10 traverses the southernmost portion of the state, traveling from west to east through Mobile. I-22 enters the state from Mississippi and connects Birmingham with Memphis, Tennessee. In addition, there are currently five auxiliary interstate routes in the state: I-165 in Mobile, I-359 in Tuscaloosa, I-459 around Birmingham, I-565 in Decatur and Huntsville, and I-759 in Gadsden. A sixth route, I-685, will be formed when I-85 is rerouted along a new southern bypass of Montgomery. A proposed northern bypass of Birmingham will be designated as I-422. Since a direct connection from I-22 to I-422 will not be possible, I-222 has been proposed, as well.\\n\\nSeveral U.S. Highways also pass through the state, such as U.S. Route 11 (US-11), US-29, US-31, US-43, US-45, US-72, US-78, US-80, US-82, US-84, US-90, US-98, US-231, US-278, US-280, US-331, US-411, and US-431.\\n\\nThere are four toll roads in the state: Montgomery Expressway in Montgomery; Northport/Tuscaloosa Western Bypass in Tuscaloosa and Northport; Emerald Mountain Expressway in Wetumpka; and Beach Express in Orange Beach.\\n\\nThe Port of Mobile, Alabama\\'s only saltwater port, is a large seaport on the Gulf of Mexico with inland waterway access to the Midwest by way of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway. The Port of Mobile was ranked 12th by tons of traffic in the United States during 2009. The newly expanded container terminal at the Port of Mobile was ranked as the 25th busiest for container traffic in the nation during 2011.

Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the \"Iliad\", other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by Paris, who shot him in the heel with an arrow. Later legends (beginning with Statius\\' unfinished epic \"Achilleid\", written in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel because, when his mother Thetis dipped him in the river Styx as an infant, she held him by one of his heels. Alluding to these legends, the term \"Achilles\\' heel\" has come to mean a point of weakness, especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution. The Achilles tendon is also named after him due to these legends.\\n\\nLinear B tablets attest to the personal name \"Achilleus\" in the forms \"a-ki-re-u\" and \"a-ki-re-we\", the latter being the dative of the former. The name grew more popular, even becoming common soon after the seventh century BC and was also turned into the female form Ἀχιλλεία (\"Achilleía\"), attested in Attica in the fourth century BC (IG II² 1617) and, in the form \"Achillia\", on a stele in Halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an \"Amazon\".\\n\\nAchilles\\' name can be analyzed as a combination of (\\') \"distress, pain, sorrow, grief\" and (\\') \"people, soldiers, nation\", resulting in a proto-form \"*Akhí-lāu̯os\" \"he who has the people distressed\" or \"he whose people have distress\". The grief or distress of the people is a theme raised numerous times in the \"Iliad\" (and frequently by Achilles himself). Achilles\\' role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of \"\" (\"glory\", usually in war). Furthermore, \"laós\" has been construed by Gregory Nagy, following Leonard Palmer, to mean \"a corps of soldiers\", a muster. With this derivation, the name obtains a double meaning in the poem: when the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring distress to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.\\n\\nAnother etymology relates the name to a Proto-Indo-European compound \"*h₂eḱ-pṓds\" \"sharp foot\" which first gave an Illyrian \"*āk̂pediós\", evolving through time into \"*ākhpdeós\" and then \"*akhiddeús\". The shift from \"-dd-\" to \"-ll-\" is then ascribed to the passing of the name into Greek via a Pre-Greek source. The first root part \"*h₂eḱ-\" \"sharp, pointed\" also gave Greek ἀκή (\"akḗ\" \"point, silence, healing\"), ἀκμή (\"akmḗ\" \"point, edge, zenith\") and ὀξύς (\"oxús\" \"sharp, pointed, keen, quick, clever\"), whereas ἄχος stems from the root \"*h₂egʰ-\" \"to be upset, afraid\". The whole expression would be comparable to the Latin \"acupedius\" \"swift of foot\". Compare also the Latin word family of \"aciēs\" \"sharp edge or point, battle line, battle, engagement\", \"acus\" \"needle, pin, bodkin\", and \"acuō\" \"to make pointed, sharpen, whet; to exercise; to arouse\" (whence \"acute\"). Some topical epitheta of Achilles in the \"Iliad\" point to this \"swift-footedness\", namely ποδάρκης δῖος Ἀχιλλεὺς (\"podárkēs dĩos Achilleús\" \"swift-footed divine Achilles\") or, even more frequently, πόδας ὠκὺς Ἀχιλλεύς (\"pódas ōkús Achilleús\" \"quick-footed Achilles\").\\n\\nSome researchers deem the name a loan word, possibly from a Pre-Greek language. Achilles\\' descent from the Nereid Thetis and a similarity of his name with those of river deities such as Acheron and Achelous have led to speculations about him being an old water divinity (see below Worship). Robert S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin of the name, based among other things on the coexistence of \"-λλ-\" and \"-λ-\" in epic language, which may account for a palatalized phoneme /l/ in the original language.\\n\\nAchilles was the son of the Nereid Thetis and of Peleus, the king of the Myrmidons. Zeus and Poseidon had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until Prometheus, the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy (originally uttered by Themis, goddess of divine law) that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed Peleus.\\n\\nThere is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: In the \"Argonautica\" (4.760) Zeus\\' sister and wife Hera alludes to Thetis\\' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, pointing out that Thetis was so loyal to Hera\\'s marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods. Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god Nereus, was also brought up by Hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus. Zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal.\\n\\nAccording to the \"Achilleid\", written by Statius in the 1st century AD, and to non-surviving previous sources, when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river Styx; however, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him: his left heel (see Achilles\\' heel, Achilles\\' tendon). It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier. In another version of this story, Thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire in order to burn away the mortal parts of his body. She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage.\\n\\nNone of the sources before Statius make any reference to this general invulnerability. To the contrary, in the \"Iliad\" Homer mentions Achilles being wounded: in Book 21 the Paeonian hero Asteropaeus, son of Pelagon, challenged Achilles by the river Scamander. He cast two spears at once, one grazed Achilles\\' elbow, \"drawing a spurt of blood\".\\n\\nAlso, in the fragmentary poems of the Epic Cycle in which one can find description of the hero\\'s death (i.e. the \"Cypria\", the \"Little Iliad\" by Lesches of Pyrrha, the \"Aithiopis\" and \"Iliou persis\" by Arctinus of Miletus), there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel; in the later vase paintings presenting the death of Achilles, the arrow (or in many cases, arrows) hit his torso.\\n\\nPeleus entrusted Achilles to Chiron the Centaur, on Mount Pelion, to be reared. Thetis foretold that her son\\'s fate was either to gain glory and die young, or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity. Achilles chose the former, and decided to take part in the Trojan war. According to Homer, Achilles grew up in Phthia together with his companion Patroclus.\\n\\nAccording to Photius, the sixth book of the \"New History\" by Ptolemy Hephaestion reported that Thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by Peleus; but when she had Achilles, Peleus noticed, tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot, and confided him to the centaur Chiron. Later Chiron exhumed the body of the Damysus, who was the fastest of all the giants, removed the ankle, and incorporated it into Achilles\\' burnt foot.\\n\\nAmong the appellations under which Achilles is generally known are the following:\\n\\n\\nSome post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hid the young man at the court of Lycomedes, king of Skyros. There, Achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among Lycomedes\\' daughters, perhaps under the name \"Pyrrha\" (the red-haired girl). With Lycomedes\\' daughter Deidamia, whom in the account of Statius he rapes, Achilles there fathers a son, Neoptolemus (also called Pyrrhus, after his father\\'s possible alias). According to this story, Odysseus learns from the prophet Calchas that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles\\' aid. Odysseus goes to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women\\'s clothes and jewellery and places a shield and spear among his goods. When Achilles instantly takes up the spear, Odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the Greek campaign. In another version of the story, Odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes\\' women; while the women flee in panic, Achilles prepares to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.\\n\\nAccording to the \"Iliad\", Achilles arrived at Troy with 50 ships, each carrying 50 Myrmidons. He appointed five leaders (each leader commanding 500 Myrmidons): Menesthius, Eudorus, Peisander, Phoenix and Alcimedon.\\n\\nWhen the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in Mysia, ruled by King Telephus. In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that \"he that wounded shall heal\". Guided by the oracle, he arrived at Argos, where Achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy.\\n\\nAccording to other reports in Euripides\\' lost play about Telephus, he went to Aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound. Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge. Alternatively, Telephus held Orestes for ransom, the ransom being Achilles\\' aid in healing the wound. Odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore, the spear must be able to heal it. Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed.\\n\\nAccording to the \"Cypria\" (the part of the Epic Cycle that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles\\' wrath), when the Achaeans desired to return home, they were restrained by Achilles, who afterwards attacked the cattle of Aeneas, sacked neighbouring cities (like Pedasus and Lyrnessus, where the Greeks capture the queen Briseis) and killed Tenes, a son of Apollo, as well as Priam\\'s son Troilus in the sanctuary of Apollo Thymbraios; however, the romance between Troilus and Chryseis described in Geoffrey Chaucer\\'s \"Troilus and Criseyde\" and in William Shakespeare\\'s \"Troilus and Cressida\" is a medieval invention.\\n\\nIn Dares Phrygius\\' \"Account of the Destruction of Troy\", the Latin summary through which the story of Achilles was transmitted to medieval Europe, as well as in older accounts, Troilus was a young Trojan prince, the youngest of King Priam\\'s and Hecuba\\'s five legitimate sons (or according other sources, another son of Apollo). Despite his youth, he was one of the main Trojan war leaders, a \"horse fighter\" or \"chariot fighter\" according to Homer. Prophecies linked Troilus\\' fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him. Yet Achilles, struck by the beauty of both Troilus and his sister Polyxena, and overcome with lust, directed his sexual attentions on the youth\\xa0– who, refusing to yield, instead found himself decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo Thymbraios. Later versions of the story suggested Troilus was accidentally killed by Achilles in an over-ardent lovers\\' embrace. In this version of the myth, Achilles\\' death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege. Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents. Had Troilus lived to adulthood, the First Vatican Mythographer claimed, Troy would have been invincible; however, the motif is older and found already in Plautus\\' \"Bacchides\".\\n\\nHomer\\'s \"Iliad\" is the most famous narrative of Achilles\\' deeds in the Trojan War. Achilles\\' wrath (μῆνις Ἀχιλλέως, \"mênis Achilléōs\") is the central theme of the poem. The first two lines of the \"Iliad\" read:\\nThe Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decade-long war, and does not narrate Achilles\\' death. It begins with Achilles\\' withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by Agamemnon, the commander of the Achaean forces. Agamemnon has taken a woman named Chryseis as his slave. Her father Chryses, a priest of Apollo, begs Agamemnon to return her to him. Agamemnon refuses, and Apollo sends a plague amongst the Greeks. The prophet Calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him. Achilles does so, and Calchas declares that Chryseis must be returned to her father. Agamemnon consents, but then commands that Achilles\\' battle prize Briseis, the daughter of Briseus, be brought to him to replace Chryseis. Angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away (and, as he says later, because he loves Briseis), with the urging of his mother Thetis, Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces. At the same time, burning with rage over Agamemnon\\'s theft, Achilles prays to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war, so that he may regain his honour.\\n\\nAs the battle turns against the Greeks, thanks to the influence of Zeus, Nestor declares that the Trojans are winning because Agamemnon has angered Achilles, and urges the king to appease the warrior. Agamemnon agrees and sends Odysseus and two other chieftains, Ajax and Phoenix, to Achilles with the offer of the return of Briseis and other gifts. Achilles rejects all Agamemnon offers him and simply urges the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do.\\n\\nThe Trojans, led by Hector, subsequently push the Greek army back toward the beaches and assault the Greek ships. With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction, Patroclus leads the Myrmidons into battle, wearing Achilles\\' armour, though Achilles remains at his camp. Patroclus succeeds in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but is killed by Hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of Troy.\\n\\nAfter receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from Antilochus, the son of Nestor, Achilles grieves over his beloved companion\\'s death. His mother Thetis comes to comfort the distraught Achilles. She persuades Hephaestus to make new armour for him, in place of the armour that Patroclus had been wearing, which was taken by Hector. The new armour includes the Shield of Achilles, described in great detail in the poem.\\n\\nEnraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field, killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector. Achilles even engages in battle with the river god Scamander, who has become angry that Achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed. The god tries to drown Achilles but is stopped by Hera and Hephaestus. Zeus himself takes note of Achilles\\' rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack Troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles can defy fate itself. Finally, Achilles finds his prey. Achilles chases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before Athena, in the form of Hector\\'s favorite and dearest brother, Deiphobus, persuades Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face. After Hector realizes the trick, he knows the battle is inevitable. Wanting to go down fighting, he charges at Achilles with his only weapon, his sword, but misses. Accepting his fate, Hector begs Achilles, not to spare his life, but to treat his body with respect after killing him. Achilles tells Hector it is hopeless to expect that of him, declaring that \"my rage, my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have caused me\". Achilles then kills Hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot. After having a dream where Patroclus begs Achilles to hold his funeral, Achilles hosts a series of funeral games in his honour.\\n\\nAt the onset of his duel with Hector, Achilles is referred to as the brightest star in the sky, which comes on in the autumn, Orion\\'s dog (Sirius); a sign of evil. During the cremation of Patroclus, he is compared to Hesperus, the evening/western star (Venus), while the burning of the funeral pyre lasts until Phosphorus, the morning/eastern star (also Venus) has set (descended).\\n\\nWith the assistance of the god Hermes (Argeiphontes), Hector\\'s father Priam goes to Achilles\\' tent to plead with Achilles for the return of Hector\\'s body so that he can be buried. Achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral, lasting 9 days with a burial on the 10th (in the tradition of Niobe\\'s offspring). The poem ends with a description of Hector\\'s funeral, with the doom of Troy and Achilles himself still to come.\\n\\nThe \"Aethiopis\" (7th century BC) and a work named \"Posthomerica\", composed by Quintus of Smyrna in the fourth century AD, relate further events from the Trojan War. When Penthesilea, queen of the Amazons and daughter of Ares, arrives in Troy, Priam hopes that she will defeat Achilles. After his temporary truce with Priam, Achilles fights and kills the warrior queen, only to grieve over her death later. At first, he was so distracted by her beauty, he did not fight as intensely as usual. Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life, he refocused and killed her.\\n\\nFollowing the death of Patroclus, Nestor\\'s son Antilochus becomes Achilles\\' closest companion. When Memnon, son of the Dawn Goddess Eos and king of Ethiopia, slays Antilochus, Achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield, killing Memnon. Consequently, Eos will not let the sun rise, until Zeus persuades her. The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess.\\n\\nMany Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the \"Iliad\"s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles\\' reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic \"Aethiopis\", which was composed after the \"Iliad\", possibly in the 7th century BC. The \"Aethiopis\" is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors.\\n\\nThe exact nature of Achilles\\' relationship with Patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times. In the \"Iliad\", it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship. Homer does not suggest that Achilles and his close friend Patroclus were lovers. Although there is no direct evidence in the text of the \"Iliad\" that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers, this theory was expressed by some later authors. Commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. In 5th-century BC Athens, the intense bond was often viewed in light of the Greek custom of \"paiderasteia\". In Plato\\'s \"Symposium\", the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple; Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover. But ancient Greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual, and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women. Many pairs of men throughout history have been compared to Achilles and Patroclus to imply a homosexual relationship.\\n\\nThe death of Achilles, even if considered solely as it occurred in the oldest sources, is a complex one, with many different versions. In the oldest one, the \"Iliad\", and as predicted by Hector with his dying breath, the hero\\'s death was brought about by Paris with an arrow (to the heel according to Statius). In some versions, the god Apollo guided Paris\\' arrow. Some retellings also state that Achilles was scaling the gates of Troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow. All of these versions deny Paris any sort of valour, owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was, and Achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield. His bones were mingled with those of Patroclus, and funeral games were held. He was represented in the \"Aethiopis\" as living after his death in the island of Leuke at the mouth of the river Danube.\\n\\nAnother version of Achilles\\' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses, Polyxena. Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena\\'s hand in marriage. Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world\\'s greatest warrior. But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles, Paris, who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister, hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow, killing him.\\n\\nIn the \"Odyssey\", Agamemnon informs Achilles of his pompous burial and the erection of his mound at the Hellespont while they are receiving the dead suitors in Hades. He claims they built a massive burial mound on the beach of Ilion that could be seen by anyone approaching from the ocean. Achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of Patroclus. Paris was later killed by Philoctetes using the enormous bow of Heracles.\\n\\nIn Book 11 of Homer\\'s \"Odyssey\", Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as \"blessed in life, blessed in death\", responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead. But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son\\'s exploits in the Trojan war, and when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus\\' heroic actions, Achilles is filled with satisfaction. This leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how Achilles felt about the heroic life.\\n\\nAccording to some accounts, he had married Medea in life, so that after both their deaths they were united in the Elysian Fields of Hades\\xa0– as Hera promised Thetis in Apollonius\\' \"Argonautica\" (3rd century BC).\\n\\nAchilles\\' armour was the object of a feud between Odysseus and Telamonian Ajax (Ajax the greater). They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners, who after considering both men\\'s presentations decided Odysseus was more deserving of the armour. Furious, Ajax cursed Odysseus, which earned him the ire of Athena, who temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep, thinking them his comrades. After a while, when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep, he was so ashamed that he committed suicide. Odysseus eventually gave the armour to Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles. When Odysseus encounters the shade of Ajax much later in the House of Hades (\"Odyssey\" 11.543–566), Ajax is still so angry about the outcome of the competition that he refuses to speak to Odysseus.\\n\\nA relic claimed to be Achilles\\' bronze-headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of Phaselis, Lycia, a port on the Pamphylian Gulf. The city was visited in 333 BC by Alexander the Great, who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the \"Iliad\" with him, but his court biographers do not mention the spear; however, it was shown in the time of Pausanias in the 2nd century AD.\\n\\nNumerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions. At some point in the war, Achilles and Ajax were playing a board game (\"petteia\"). They were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle. The Trojans attacked and reached the heroes, who were saved only by an intervention of Athena.\\n\\nThe tomb of Achilles, extant throughout antiquity in Troad, was venerated by Thessalians, but also by Persian expeditionary forces, as well as by Alexander the Great and the Roman emperor Caracalla. Achilles\\' cult was also to be found at other places, e. g. on the island of Astypalaea in the Sporades, in Sparta which had a sanctuary, in Elis and in Achilles\\' homeland Thessaly, as well as in the Magna Graecia cities of Tarentum, Locri and Croton, accounting for an almost Panhellenic cult to the hero.\\n\\nThe cult of Achilles is illustrated in the 500 BC Polyxena sarcophagus, where the sacrifice of Polixena near the tumulus of Achilles is depicted. Strabo (13.1.32) also suggested that such a cult of Achilles existed in Troad:\\n\\nThe spread and intensity of the hero\\'s veneration among the Greeks that had settled on the northern coast of the Pontus Euxinus, today\\'s Black Sea, appears to have been remarkable. An archaic cult is attested for the Milesian colony of Olbia as well as for an island in the middle of the Black Sea, today identified with Snake Island (Ukrainian Зміїний, \"Zmiinyi\", near Kiliya, Ukraine). Early dedicatory inscriptions from the Greek colonies on the Black Sea (graffiti and inscribed clay disks, these possibly being votive offerings, from Olbia, the area of Berezan Island and the Tauric Chersonese) attest the existence of a heroic cult of Achilles from the sixth century BC onwards. The cult was still thriving in the third century AD, when dedicatory stelae from Olbia refer to an \"Achilles Pontárchēs\" (Ποντάρχης, roughly \"lord of the Sea,\" or \"of the Pontus Euxinus\"), who was invoked as a protector of the city of Olbia, venerated on par with Olympian gods such as the local Apollo Prostates, Hermes Agoraeus, or Poseidon.\\n\\nPliny the Elder (23–79 AD) in his \"Natural History\" mentions a \"port of the Achæi\" and an \"island of Achilles\", famous for the tomb of that \"man\" (portus Achaeorum, insula Achillis, tumulo eius viri clara), situated somewhat nearby Olbia and the Dnieper-Bug Estuary; furthermore, at 125\\xa0Roman miles from this island, he places a peninsula \"which stretches forth in the shape of a sword\" obliquely, called \"Dromos Achilleos\" (Ἀχιλλέως δρόμος, \"Achilléōs drómos\" \"the Race-course of Achilles\") and considered the place of the hero\\'s exercise or of games instituted by him. This last feature of Pliny\\'s account is considered to be the iconic spit, called today \"Tendra\" (or \"Kosa Tendra\" and \"Kosa Djarilgatch\"), situated between the mouth of the Dnieper and Karkinit Bay, but which is hardly 125\\xa0Roman miles (c. 185\\xa0km) away from the Dnieper-Bug estuary, as Pliny states. (To the \"Race-course\" he gives a length of 80\\xa0miles, c.\\xa0120\\xa0km, whereas the spit measures c.\\xa070\\xa0km today.)\\n\\nIn the following chapter of his book, Pliny refers to the same island as \"Achillea\" and introduces two further names for it: \"Leuce\" or \"Macaron\" (from Greek [νῆσος] μακαρῶν \"island of the blest\"). The \"present day\" measures, he gives at this point, seem to account for an identification of \"Achillea\" or \"Leuce\" with today\\'s Snake Island. Pliny\\'s contemporary Pomponius Mela (c. 43 AD) tells that Achilles was buried on an island named \"Achillea\", situated between the Borysthenes and the Ister, adding to the geographical confusion. Ruins of a square temple, measuring 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to Achilles, were discovered by Captain Kritzikly in 1823 on Snake Island. A second exploration in 1840 showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple. A fifth century BC black-glazed lekythos inscription, found on the island in 1840, reads: \"Glaukos, son of Poseidon, dedicated me to Achilles, lord of Leuke.\" In another inscription from the fifth or fourth century BC, a statue is dedicated to Achilles, lord of Leuke, by a citizen of Olbia, while in a further dedication, the city of Olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the island\\'s cult, again suggesting its quality as a place of a supra-regional hero veneration.\\n\\nThe heroic cult dedicated to Achilles on \"Leuce\" seems to go back to an account from the lost epic \"Aethiopis\" according to which, after his untimely death, Thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical Λεύκη Νῆσος (\"Leúkē Nêsos\" \"White Island\"). Already in the fifth century BC, Pindar had mentioned a cult of Achilles on a \"bright island\" (φαεννά νᾶσος, \"phaenná nâsos\") of the Black Sea, while in another of his works, Pindar would retell the story of the immortalized Achilles living on a geographically indefinite Island of the Blest together with other heroes such as his father Peleus and Cadmus. Well known is the connection of these mythological Fortunate Isles (μακαρῶν νῆσοι, \"makárôn nêsoi\") or the Homeric Elysium with the stream Oceanus which according to Greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world, which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the Euxine with it. Guy Hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of Achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by Alcaeus, speaking of \"Achilles lord of Scythia\" and the opposition of North and South, as evoked by Achilles\\' fight against the Aethiopian prince Memnon, who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother Eos after his death.\\n\\nThe \"Periplus of the Euxine Sea\" (c. 130 AD) gives the following details:\\n\\nThe Greek geographer Dionysius Periegetes, who lived probably during the first century AD, wrote that the island was called \"Leuce\" \"because the wild animals which live there are white. It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour\". Similarly, others relate the island\\'s name to its white cliffs, snakes or birds dwelling there. Pausanias has been told that the island is \"covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. In this island there is also Achilles\\' temple and his statue\". Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. Pausanias reports that the Delphic Pythia sent a lord of Croton to be cured of a chest wound. Ammianus Marcellinus attributes the healing to waters (\"aquae\") on the island.\\n\\nA number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters were dedicated to Achilles. Herodotus, Pliny the Elder and Strabo reported on the existence of a town \"Achílleion\" (Ἀχίλλειον), built by settlers from Mytilene in the sixth century BC, close to the hero\\'s presumed burial mound in the Troad. Later attestations point to an \"Achílleion\" in Messenia (according to Stephanus Byzantinus) and an \"Achílleios\" (Ἀχίλλειος) in Laconia. Nicolae Densuşianu recognized a connection to Achilles in the names of Aquileia and of the northern arm of the Danube delta, called Chilia (presumably from an older \"Achileii\"), though his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over the Black Sea, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law.\\n\\nThe kings of Epirus claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son, Neoptolemus. Alexander the Great, son of the Epirote princess Olympias, could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor. He is said to have visited the tomb of Achilles at Achilleion while passing Troy. In AD 216 the Roman Emperor Caracalla, while on his way to war against Parthia, emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles\\' tumulus.\\n\\nThe Greek tragedian Aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title \"Achilleis\" by modern scholars. The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War, including his defeat of Hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by Paris and guided by Apollo punctures his heel. Extant fragments of the \"Achilleis\" and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play. The first part of the \"Achilleis\" trilogy, \"The Myrmidons\", focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus, who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon; only a few lines survive today. In Plato\\'s \"Symposium\", Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved; Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because Achilles, being the younger and more beautiful of the two, was the beloved, who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him.\\n\\nThe tragedian Sophocles also wrote \"The Lovers of Achilles\", a play with Achilles as the main character. Only a few fragments survive.\\n\\nTowards the end of the 5th century BC, a more negative view of Achilles emerges in Greek drama; Euripides refers to Achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in \"Hecuba\", \"Electra\", and \"Iphigenia in Aulis\".\\n\\nThe philosopher Zeno of Elea centred one of his paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between \"swift-footed\" Achilles and a tortoise, by which he attempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start, and therefore that motion and change were impossible. As a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the Eleatic school, Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions.\\n\\nThe Romans, who traditionally traced their lineage to Troy, took a highly negative view of Achilles. Virgil refers to Achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men, while Horace portrays Achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children. Other writers, such as Catullus, Propertius, and Ovid, represent a second strand of disparagement, with an emphasis on Achilles\\' erotic career. This strand continues in Latin accounts of the Trojan War by writers such as Dictys Cretensis and Dares Phrygius and in Benoît de Sainte-Maure\\'s \"Roman de Troie\" and Guido delle Colonne\\'s \"Historia destructionis Troiae\", which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the Matter of Troy until the 17th century.\\n\\nAchilles was described by the Byzantine chronicler Leo the Deacon, not as Hellene, but as Scythian, while according to the Byzantine author John Malalas, his army was made up of a tribe previously known as Myrmidons and later as Bulgars.\\n\\n\\n\\nAchilles has been frequently the subject of operas, ballets and related genres.\\n\\n\\nIn films Achilles has been portrayed in the following films and television series:\\n\\nIn 1890, Elisabeth of Bavaria, Empress of Austria, had a summer palace built in Corfu. The building is named the \"Achilleion\", after Achilles. Its paintings and statuary depict scenes from the Trojan War, with particular focus on Achilles.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</doc>\\n'"

       "'anarchism anarchism is a political philosophy and movement that rejects all involuntary, coercive forms of hierarchy. it calls for the abolition of the state which it holds to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful. the history of anarchism goes back to prehistory, when some humans lived in anarchistic societies long before the establishment of formal states, realms or empires. with the rise of organised hierarchical bodies, skepticism toward authority also rose, but it was not until the 19th century that a selfconscious political movement emerged. during the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers\\' struggles for emancipation. various anarchist schools of thought formed during this period. anarchists have taken part in several revolutions, most notably in the spanish civil war, whose end marked the end of anarchism\\'s classical era. in the last decades of the 20th century and into the 21st century, the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more. anarchism employs various tactics in order to meet its ideal ends these can be broadly separated into revolutionary and evolutionary tactics. there is significant overlap between the two which are merely descriptive. revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state, and have taken a violent turn in the past. evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like. anarchist thought, criticism and praxis have played a part in diverse areas of human society. criticism of anarchism mainly focuses on claims of it being internally inconsistent, violent and utopian. the etymological origin of \"anarchism\" is from the ancient greek \"anarkhia\", meaning \"without a ruler\", composed of the prefix \"an\" i.e. \"without\" and the word \"arkhos\" i.e. \"leader\" or \"ruler\". the suffix \"ism\" denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy. \"anarchism\" appears in english from 1642 as \"anarchisme\" and \"anarchy\" from 1539. various factions within the french revolution labelled their opponents as \"anarchists\", although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists. many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as william godwin 17561836 and wilhelm weitling 18081871 would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, but they did not use \"anarchist\" or \"anarchism\" in describing themselves or their beliefs. the first political philosopher to call himself an \"anarchist\"  was pierrejoseph proudhon 18091865, marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid19th century. since the 1890s and beginning in france, \"libertarianism\" has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the united states. on the other hand, some use \"libertarianism\" to refer to individualistic freemarket philosophy only, referring to freemarket anarchism as \"libertarian anarchism\". while opposition to the state is central to anarchist thought, defining anarchism is not an easy task as there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently. hence, it might be true to say that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing authority and hierarchical organization including the state, capitalism, nationalism and all associated institutions in the conduct of all human relations in favour of a society based on voluntary association, on freedom and on decentralisation, but this definition has the same shortcomings as the definition based on etymology which is simply a negation of a ruler, or based on antistatism anarchism is much more than that or even the antiauthoritarian which is an \"a posteriori\" conclusion. nonetheless, major elements of the definition of anarchism include the following during the prehistoric era of mankind, an established authority did not exist. it was after the creation of towns and cities that institutions of authority were established and anarchistic ideas espoused as a reaction. most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in china and greece. in china, philosophical anarchism i.e. the discussion on the legitimacy of the state was delineated by taoist philosophers zhuang zhou and laozi. likewise, anarchic attitudes were articulated by tragedians and philosophers in greece. aeschylus and sophocles used the myth of antigone to illustrate the conflict between rules set by the state and personal autonomy. socrates questioned athenian authorities constantly and insisted to the right of individual freedom of consciousness. cynics dismissed human law \"nomos\" and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature \"physis\". stoics were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state. during the middle ages, there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements in the muslim world or in christian europe. this kind of tradition later gave birth to religious anarchism. in the sasanian empire, mazdak called for an egalitarian society and the abolition of monarchy, only to be soon executed by emperor kavad i. in basra, religious sects preached against the state. in europe, various sects developed antistate and libertarian tendencies. libertarian ideas further emerged during the renaissance with the spread of reasoning and humanism through europe. novelists fictionalised ideal societies that were based not on coercion but voluntarism. the enlightenment further pushed towards anarchism with the optimism for social progress. during the french revolution, partisan groups such as the enrags and the saw a turning point in the fermentation of antistate and federalist sentiments. the first anarchist currents developed throughout the 18th centurywilliam godwin espoused philosophical anarchism in england, morally delegitimizing the state, max stirner\\'s thinking paved the way to individualism, and pierrejoseph proudhon\\'s theory of mutualism found fertile soil in france. this era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the spanish civil war of 1936 and is considered the golden age of anarchism. drawing from mutualism, mikhail bakunin founded collectivist anarchism and entered the international workingmen\\'s association, a class worker union later known as the first international that formed in 1864 to unite diverse revolutionary currents. the international became a significant political force, with karl marx being a leading figure and a member of its general council. bakunin\\'s faction the jura federation and proudhon\\'s followers the mutualists opposed marxist state socialism, advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings. after bitter disputes, the bakuninists were expelled from the international by the marxists at the 1872 hague congress. bakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by marx\\'s terms, they would end up the new tyrants of workers. after being expelled, anarchists formed the st. imier international. under the influence of peter kropotkin, a russian philosopher and scientist, anarchocommunism overlapped with collectivism. anarchocommunists, who drew inspiration from the 1871 paris commune, advocated for free federation and for the distribution of goods according to one\\'s needs. at the turn of the century, anarchism had spread all over the world. in china, small groups of students imported the humanistic proscience version of anarchocommunism. tokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the far east, travelling to the japanese capital to study. in latin america, argentina was a stronghold for anarchosyndicalism, where it became the most prominent leftwing ideology. during this time, a minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary political violence. this strategy became known as propaganda of the deed. the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups, and the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies following the suppression of the paris commune, favoured individualist political expression and acts. even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts, infamy came upon the movement. illegalism was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during this period. anarchists enthusiastically participated in the russian revolutiondespite concernsin opposition to the whites. however, they met harsh suppression after the bolshevik government was stabilized. several anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to ukraine, notably leading to the kronstadt rebellion and nestor makhno\\'s struggle in the free territory. with the anarchists being crushed in russia, two new antithetical currents emerged, namely platformism and synthesis anarchism. the former sought to create a coherent group that would push for revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party. seeing the victories of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war, many workers and activists turned to communist parties, which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. in france and the united states, members of major syndicalist movements, the general confederation of labour and industrial workers of the world, left their organisations and joined the communist international. in the spanish civil war, anarchists and syndicalists cnt and fai once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists. a long tradition of spanish anarchism led to anarchists playing a pivotal role in the war. in response to the army rebellion, an anarchistinspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain, where they collectivised the land. the soviet union provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war, but the result was a bitter fight among communists and anarchists at a series of events named may days as joseph stalin tried to seize control of the republicans. at the end of world war ii, the anarchist movement was severely weakened. however, the 1960s witnessed a revival of anarchism likely caused by a perceived failure of marxismleninism and tensions built by the cold war. during this time, anarchism took root in other movements critical towards both the state and capitalism, such as the antinuclear, environmental and pacifist movements, the new left, and the counterculture of the 1960s. anarchism became associated with punk subculture, as exemplified by bands such as crass and the sex pistols, and the established feminist tendencies of anarchafeminism returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism. around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence within antiwar, anticapitalist, and antiglobalisation movements. anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the world trade organization, the group of eight and the world economic forum. during the protests, \"ad hoc\" leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with the police. other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include security culture, affinity groups, and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet. a significant event of this period was the confrontations at the wto conference in seattle in 1999. anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the zapatistas in mexico and the democratic federation of northern syria, more commonly known as rojava, a \"de facto\" autonomous region in northern syria. anarchist schools of thought have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions, social anarchism and individualist anarchism, owing to their different origins, values and evolution. the individualist current emphasises negative liberty in opposing restraints upon the free individual, while the social current emphasises positive liberty in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and social ownership. in a chronological sense, anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late 19th century, and the postclassical currents such as anarchafeminism, green anarchism and postanarchism developed thereafter. beyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies philosophical anarchism, which holds that the state lacks moral legitimacy, without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it. a component especially of individualist anarchism, philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of a minimal state, but argues that citizens have no moral obligation to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy. anarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since ethics have a central role in anarchist philosophy. one reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives, a call for toleration and unity among anarchists first adopted by fernando tarrida del mrmol in 1889 in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time. despite separation, the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities, but as tendencies that intermingle. anarchism is usually placed on the farleft of the political spectrum. much of its economics and legal philosophy reflect antiauthoritarian, antistatist, and libertarian interpretations of the radical leftwing and socialist politics of collectivism, communism, individualism, mutualism, and syndicalism, among other libertarian socialist economic theories. as anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview, many anarchist types and traditions exist, and varieties of anarchy diverge widely. inceptive currents among classical anarchist currents were mutualism and individualism. they were followed by the major currents of social anarchism collectivist, communist, and syndicalist. they differ on organizational and economic aspects of their ideal society. mutualism is an 18thcentury economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by pierrejoseph proudhon. its aims include reciprocity, free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform that would be regulated by a bank of the people. mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism. proudhon first characterised his goal as a \"third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property\". collectivist anarchism, also known as anarchist collectivism or anarchocollectivism, is a revolutionary socialist form of anarchism commonly associated with mikhail bakunin. collectivist anarchists advocate collective ownership of the means of production, theorised to be achieved through violent revolution, and that workers be paid according to time worked, rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism. collectivist anarchism arose alongside marxism, but rejected the dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society. anarchocommunism, also known as anarchistcommunism, communist anarchism, and libertarian communism, is a theory of anarchism that advocates a communist society with common ownership of the means of production, direct democracy, and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers\\' councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle \"from each according to his ability, to each according to his need\". anarchocommunism developed from radical socialist currents after the french revolution, but it was first formulated as such in the italian section of the first international. it was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of peter kropotkin. anarchosyndicalism, also referred to as revolutionary syndicalism, is a branch of anarchism that views labour syndicates as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically selfmanaged by workers. the basic principles of anarchosyndicalism are workers\\' solidarity, direct action, and workers\\' selfmanagement. individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants. early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include william godwin, max stirner and henry david thoreau. through many countries, individualist anarchism attracted a small yet diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation. anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left. interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the antiglobalization movement, whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation. as the movement shaped 21st century radicalism, wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest. contemporary news coverage which emphasizes black bloc demonstrations has reinforced anarchism\\'s historical association with chaos and violence, although its publicity has also led more scholars to engage with the anarchist movement. anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movementsat times eclectic, drawing upon various sources, and syncretic, combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches. the anticapitalist tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents. various anarchist groups, tendencies, and schools of thought exist today, making it difficult to describe contemporary anarchist movement. while theorists and activists have established \"relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles\", there is no consensus on which principles are core. as a result, commentators describe multiple \"anarchisms\" rather than a singular \"anarchism\" in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently. for example, gender equality can be a common principle but ranks as a higher priority to anarchafeminists than anarchist communists. anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms, namely \"all centralized and hierarchical forms of government e.g., monarchy, representative democracy, state socialism, etc., economic class systems e.g., capitalism, bolshevism, feudalism, slavery, etc., autocratic religions e.g., fundamentalist islam, roman catholicism, etc., patriarchy, heterosexism, white supremacy, and imperialism\". however, anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed. anarchists\\' tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goalsfirst, to oppose the establishment and second, to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society, illustrating the unity of means and ends. a broad categorization can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary means, and aims to change society through evolutionary means. evolutionary tactics reject violence and take a gradual approach to anarchist aims, though there is significant overlap between the two. anarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century. anarchists during the early 20th century focused more on strikes and militancy, while contemporary anarchists use a broader array of approaches. during the classical era, anarchists had a militant tendency. not only did they confront state armed forces as in spain and ukraine but some of them also employed terrorism as propaganda of the deed. assassination attempts were carried out against heads of state, some of which were successful. anarchists also took part in revolutions. anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been perplexing and controversial. on one hand, anarchopacifists point out the unity of means and ends. on the other hand, other anarchist groups advocate direct action, a tactic which can include acts of sabotage or even acts of terrorism. this attitude was quite prominent a century ago seeing the state as a tyrant, some anarchists believed that they had every right to oppose its oppression by any means possible. emma goldman and errico malatesta, who were proponents of limited use of violence, argued that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a necessary evil. anarchists took an active role in strikes, although they tended to be antipathetic to formal syndicalism, seeing it as reformist. they saw it as a part of the movement which sought to overthrow the state and capitalism. anarchists also reinforced their propaganda within the arts, some of whom practiced nudism. they also built communities which were based on friendship. they were also involved in the press. in the current era, italian anarchist alfredo bonanno, a proponent of insurrectionary anarchism, has reinstated the debate on violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late 19th century by kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards. both bonanno and the french group the invisible committee advocate for small, informal affiliation groups, where each member is responsible for their own actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state, capitalism and other enemies. members of the invisible committee were arrested in 2008 on various charges, terrorism included. overall, today\\'s anarchists are much less violent and militant than their ideological ancestors. they mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots, especially in countries like canada, mexico or greece. ilitant black bloc protest groups are known for clashing with the police. however, anarchists not only clash with state operators they also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists, taking antifascist action and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening. anarchists commonly employ direct action. this can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchy, or the form of selfmanaging their lives through the creation of counterinstitutions such as communes and nonhierarchical collectives. often, decisionmaking is handled in an antiauthoritarian way, with everyone having equal say in each decision, an approach known as horizontalism. contemporaryera anarchists have been engaging with various grassroots movements that are not explicitly anarchist but are more or less based on horizontalism, respecting personal autonomy, and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations. the newly coined term \"smalla anarchism\", in contrast with the \"biga anarchism\" of the classical era, signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classicalera anarchism or to refer to kropotkin or proudhon to justify their opinions. they would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience, which they will later theorize. the decisionmaking process of small affinity anarchist groups play a significant tactical role. anarchists have employed various methods in order to build a rough consensus among members of their group, without the need of a leader or a leading group. one way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to help achieve a consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting a specific point. minorities usually accept rough consensus, except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist goals, values, or ethics. anarchists usually form small groups 520 individuals to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members. these kind of groups more often than not interconnect with each other, forming larger networks. anarchists still support and participate in strikes, especially wildcat strikes these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by a syndicate. anarchists have gone online to spread their message. as in the past, newspapers and journals are used however, because of distributional and other difficulties, anarchists have found it easier to create websites, hosting electronic libraries and other portals. anarchists were also involved in developing various software that are available for free. the way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals, especially when it comes to preserving users\\' privacy from state surveillance. anarchists organize themselves to squat and reclaim public spaces. during important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied, they are often called temporary autonomous zones taz, spaces where surrealism, poetry and art are blended to display the anarchist ideal. as seen by anarchists, squatting is a way to regain urban space from the capitalist market, serving pragmatical needs, and is also seen an exemplary direct action. acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds. adding up these tactics, and having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them, along with various forms of protesting at highly symbolic events, make up a carnivalesque atmosphere that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity. as anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies, and schools of thought, and disagreement over questions of values, ideology, and tactics is common, its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has created a number of definitional concerns in anarchist theory. for instance, the compatibility of capitalism, nationalism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed. similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as marxism, communism, collectivism and trade unionism. anarchists may be motivated by humanism, divine authority, enlightened selfinterest, veganism, or any number of alternative ethical doctrines. phenomena such as civilisation, technology e.g. within anarchoprimitivism and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others. gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy anarchism is obliged to address, analyse and oppose the suppression of one\\'s autonomy because of the dynamics that gender roles traditionally impose. a historical current that arose and flourished during 1890 and 1920 within anarchism was free love in contemporary anarchism, this current survives as a tendency to support polyamory and queer anarchism. free love advocates were against marriage, which they saw as a way of men imposing authority over women, largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men. the notion of free love, though, was much broader it included critique of the established order that limited women\\'s sexual freedom and pleasure. such free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses, where large groups of travelers, anarchists, and other activists slept in beds together. free love had roots both in europe and the united states. some anarchists, however, struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love. anarchist feminists were advocates of free love, against marriage, were prochoice utilizing a contemporary term and had a likewise agenda. anarchist and nonanarchist feminists differed on suffrage, but were nonetheless supportive of one another. during the second half of the 20th century, anarchism intermingled with the second wave of feminism, radicalizing some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well. by the latest decades of the 20th century, anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women, gays, queers and other marginalized groups, with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents. with the third wave of feminism, sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became a subject of study for anarchists, which yielded a poststructuralist critique of sexual normality. however, some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking, suggesting that it leaned towards individualism and was, therefore, dropping the cause of social liberation. the interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism. anarchists consider \\'proper\\' education, which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society, to be an act of mutual aid. anarchist writers such as willian godwin and max stirner attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges. in 1901, catalan anarchist and free thinker francisco ferrer established the escuela moderna in barcelona as an opposition to the established education system, which was dictated largely by the catholic church. ferrer\\'s approach was secular, rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational process, and gave pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance. ferrer aimed to educate the working class and explicitly sought to foster class consciousness among students. the school closed after constant harassment by the state and ferrer was later arrested. his ideas, however, formed the inspiration for a series of modern schools around the world. christian anarchist leo tolstoy also established a similar school, with its founding principle, according to tolstoy, being that \"for education to be effective it had to be free\". in a similar token, a. s. neill founding what became summerhill school in 1921, also declaring being free from coercion. anarchist education is based largely on the idea that a child\\'s right to develop freely, without manipulation, ought to be respected, and that rationality will lead children to morally good conclusions. however, there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation ferrer, for example, believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality, liberty, and social justice were not possible under capitalism along with other critiques of nationalism and government. late 20th century and contemporary anarchist writers such as colin ward, herbert read and paul goodman intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education, largely focusing on the need for a system that focuses on children\\'s creativity rather than on their ability to attain a career or participate in consumer society. contemporary anarchists, such as colin ward, have further argued that state education serves to perpetuate socioeconomic inequality. while few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modern day, major tenets of anarchist schools, such as respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method, have spread among mainstream educational institutions. objection to the state and its institutions is a \"sine qua non\" of anarchism. anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and believe it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies. instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life, major decisions are taken by a small elite. authority ultimately rests solely on power, regardless of whether that power is open or transparent, as it still has the ability to coerce people. another anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting a government, even the most altruistic among officials, will unavoidably seek to gain more power, leading to corruption. anarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an unachievable fiction, due to the fact that the ruling class is distinct from the rest of society. the connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism, especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era, such as futurists, surrealists, and others, while in literature anarchism was mostly associated with the new apocalyptics and the neoromanticism movement. in music, anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as punk. anarchists such as leo tolstoy and herbert read argued that the border between the artist and the nonartist, what separates art from a daily act, is a construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism, and it prevents humans from living a joyful life. other anarchists advocated for or used art as a means to achieve anarchist ends. in his book breaking the spell a history of anarchist filmmakers, videotape guerrillas, and digital ninjas, chris rob claims that \"anarchistinflected practices have increasingly structured movementbased video activism.\" throughout the 20th century many prominent anarchists, such as peter kropotkin, emma goldman, gustav landauer, and camillo berneri, and publications, such as \"anarchy\", wrote about matters pertaining to the arts. three overlapping properties made art useful to anarchists it could depict a critique of existing society and hierarchies it could serve as a prefigurative tool to reflect the anarchist ideal society, and also it could turn into a means of direct action, in protests for example. as it appeals to both emotion and reason, art could appeal to the \"whole human\" and have a powerful effect. the most common critique of anarchism is that humans can not self govern and a state is necessary for human survival. philosopher bertrand russell supported this critique, noting that \"peace and war, tariffs, regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs, the preservation of a just system of distribution these, among others, are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government.\" philosophy lecturer andrew g. fiala also believed that humans could not self govern and included it in his list of arguments against anarchism. fiala\\'s other critiques were that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction, not only in the pragmatic world i.e. at protests but in the world of ethics as well. secondly, anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state can not be defeated practically this line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it. the third argument is that anarchism is selfcontradictory since while it advocates for noone to \"archiei\", if accepted by the many, then anarchism will turn into the ruling political theory. in this line of criticism also comes the self contradiction that anarchist calls for collective action while anarchism endorses the autonomy of the individual and hence no collective action can be taken. lastly, fiala mentions a critique towards philosophical anarchism, of being ineffective all talk and thoughts and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong. philosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia, following the release of proanarchist books such as a. john simmons\\' \"moral principles and political obligations\" 1979. law professor william a. edmundson authored an essay arguing against three major philosophical anarchist principles, which he finds fallacious edmundson claims that while the individual does not owe a normal state a duty of obedience, this does not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion, and the state is still morally legitimate. academic john molyneux notes in his book \"anarchism a marxist criticism\" that \"anarchism cannot win\" believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas.\\n autism autism is a developmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior. parents often notice signs during the first three years of their child\\'s life. these signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism experience worsening in their communication and social skills after reaching developmental milestones at a normal pace. autism is associated with a combination of genetic and environmental factors. risk factors during pregnancy include certain infections, such as rubella, toxins including valproic acid, alcohol, cocaine, pesticides, lead, and air pollution, fetal growth restriction, and autoimmune diseases. controversies surround other proposed environmental causes for example, the vaccine hypothesis, which has been disproven. autism affects information processing in the brain and how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize how this occurs is not well understood. the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm5, combines autism and less severe forms of the condition, including asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified pddnos into the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder asd. early behavioral interventions or speech therapy can help children with autism gain selfcare, social, and communication skills. although there is no known cure, there have been cases of children who recovered. some autistic adults are unable to live independently. an autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference to be accommodated instead of cured. globally, autism is estimated to affect 24.8 million people . in the 2000s, the number of people affected was estimated at 12 per 1,000 people worldwide. in the developed countries, about 1.5 of children are diagnosed with asd , from 0.7 in 2000 in the united states. it occurs fourtofive times more often in males than females. the number of people diagnosed has increased dramatically since the 1960s, which may be partly due to changes in diagnostic practice. the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved. autism is a highly variable, neurodevelopmental disorder whose symptoms first appear during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without remission. people with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but average, or even superior, in others. overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form. it is distinguished by a characteristic triad of symptoms impairments in social interaction, impairments in communication, and repetitive behavior. other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis. individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits. social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders asd see classification from other developmental disorders. people with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. noted autistic temple grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals, or people with typical neural development, as leaving her feeling \"like an anthropologist on mars\". unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood. autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms for example, they have less eye contact and turntaking, and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things. three to fiveyearold children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. however, they do form attachments to their primary caregivers. most children with autism display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less pronounced autistic traits. older children and adults with asd perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person\\'s own emotions. children with highfunctioning autism have more intense and frequent loneliness compared to nonautistic peers, despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone. making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. for them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply. there are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with asd. the limited data suggest that, in children with intellectual disability, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and meltdowns. about a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. in the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations their gestures are less often integrated with words. children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others\\' words echolalia or reverse pronouns. joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with asd. for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointedat object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language. in a pair of studies, highfunctioning children with autism aged 815 performed equally well as, and as adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. as people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends. autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the repetitive behavior scalerevised rbsr categorizes as follows. no single repetitive or selfinjurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors. autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but that can affect the individual or the family. an estimated 0.5 to 10 of individuals with asd show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants. many individuals with asd show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population. sensory abnormalities are found in over 90 of those with autism, and are considered core features by some, although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. differences are greater for underresponsivity for example, walking into things than for overresponsivity for example, distress from loud noises or for sensation seeking for example, rhythmic movements. an estimated 6080 of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone, poor motor planning, and toe walking deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across asd and are greater in autism proper. unusual eating behavior occurs in about threequarters of children with asd, to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator. selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur. there is tentative evidence that autism occurs more frequently in people with gender dysphoria. gastrointestinal problems are one of the most commonly associated medical disorders in people with autism. these are linked to greater social impairment, irritability, behavior and sleep problems, language impairments and mood changes. parents of children with asd have higher levels of stress. siblings of children with asd report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship. however, they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with down syndrome siblings of individuals with asd have greater risk of negative wellbeing and poorer sibling relationships as adults. it has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autism\\'s characteristic triad of symptoms. however, there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often cooccur. autism has a strong genetic basis, although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by rare mutations with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants. complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and epigenetic factors which do not change dna sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression. many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents. studies of twins suggest that heritability is 0.7 for autism and as high as 0.9 for asd, and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population. however, most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified. typically, autism cannot be traced to a mendelian singlegene mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality, and none of the genetic syndromes associated with asds have been shown to selectively cause asd. numerous candidate genes have been located, with only small effects attributable to any particular gene. most loci individually explain less than 1 of cases of autism. the large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural variationsuch as deletions, duplications or inversions in genetic material during meiosis. hence, a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited that is, the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome. autism may be underdiagnosed in women and girls due to an assumption that it is primarily a male condition, but genetic phenomena such as imprinting and x linkage have the ability to raise the frequency and severity of conditions in males, and theories have been put forward for a genetic reason why males are diagnosed more often, such as the imprinted brain theory and the extreme male brain theory. maternal nutrition and inflammation during preconception and pregnancy influences fetal neurodevelopment. intrauterine growth restriction is associated with asd, in both term and preterm infants. maternal inflammatory and autoimmune diseases may damage fetal tissues, aggravating a genetic problem or damaging the nervous system. exposure to air pollution during pregnancy, especially heavy metals and particulates, may increase the risk of autism. environmental factors that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods, infectious diseases, solvents, pcbs, phthalates and phenols used in plastic products, pesticides, brominated flame retardants, alcohol, smoking, illicit drugs, vaccines, and prenatal stress. some, such as the mmr vaccine, have been completely disproven. parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination. this has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine \"overload\", a vaccine preservative, or the mmr vaccine for causing autism. the latter theory was supported by a litigationfunded study that has since been shown to have been \"an elaborate fraud\". although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible, parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations, outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children. autism\\'s symptoms result from maturationrelated changes in various systems of the brain. how autism occurs is not well understood. its mechanism can be divided into two areas the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism, and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors. the behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies. there is evidence that gutbrain axis abnormalities may be involved. a 2015 review proposed that immune dysregulation, gastrointestinal inflammation, malfunction of the autonomic nervous system, gut flora alterations, and food metabolites may cause brain neuroinflammation and dysfunction. a 2016 review concludes that enteric nervous system abnormalities might play a role in neurological disorders such as autism. neural connections and the immune system are a pathway that may allow diseases originated in the intestine to spread to the brain. several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism. some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways, such as those involved with cell adhesion. gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activitydependent changes. all known teratogens agents that cause birth defects related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception, and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later, there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development. diagnosis is based on behavior, not cause or mechanism. under the dsm5, autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts, as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. these deficits are present in early childhood, typically before age three, and lead to clinically significant functional impairment. sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language, and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects. the disturbance must not be better accounted for by rett syndrome, intellectual disability or global developmental delay. icd10 uses essentially the same definition. several diagnostic instruments are available. two are commonly used in autism research the autism diagnostic interviewrevised adir is a semistructured parent interview, and the autism diagnostic observation schedule ados uses observation and interaction with the child. the childhood autism rating scale cars is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children. the diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders disco may also be used. a pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. if warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from asd specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated medical conditions. a pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions. a differential diagnosis for asd at this stage might also consider intellectual disability, hearing impairment, and a specific language impairment such as landaukleffner syndrome. the presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression. clinical genetics evaluations are often done once asd is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause. although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40 of cases to genetic causes, consensus guidelines in the us and uk are limited to highresolution chromosome and fragile x testing. a genotypefirst model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome\\'s copy number variations. as new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge. commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results, given the complexity of autism\\'s genetics. metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful, but are not routine. asd can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life for example, a oneyearold who meets diagnostic criteria for asd is less likely than a threeyearold to continue to do so a few years later. in the uk the national autism plan for children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice. although the symptoms of autism and asd begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits. girls are often diagnosed later than boys. underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported asd cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. the increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose asd, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis. it is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired, partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindisms. autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders pdd, which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior. these symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance. of the five pdd forms, asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes pdd not otherwise specified pddnos also called \"atypical autism\" is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder. unlike with autism, people with asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development. the terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, asperger syndrome and pddnos often called the \"autism spectrum disorders\" asd or sometimes the \"autistic disorders\", whereas autism itself is often called \"autistic disorder\", \"childhood autism\", or \"infantile autism\". in this article, \"autism\" refers to the classic autistic disorder in clinical practice, though, \"autism\", \"asd\", and \"pdd\" are often used interchangeably. asd, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism phenotype, which describes individuals who may not have asd but do have autisticlike traits, such as avoiding eye contact. autism can also be divided into syndromal and nonsyndromal autism the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound intellectual disability or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms, such as tuberous sclerosis. although individuals with asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism, the extent of the overlap between asperger syndrome, hfa, and nonsyndromal autism is unclear. some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills, as opposed to a failure to make progress, typically from 15 to 30 months of age. the validity of this distinction remains controversial it is possible that regressive autism is a specific subtype, or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression. research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry, psychology, neurology and pediatrics. newer technologies such as fmri and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes observable traits that can be viewed on brain scans, to help further neurogenetic studies of autism one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain, which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects. it has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior. autism has long been thought to cover a wide spectrum, ranging from individuals with severe impairmentswho may be silent, developmentally disabled, and prone to frequent repetitive behavior such as hand flapping and rockingto high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, pedantic communication. because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary. sometimes the syndrome is divided into low, medium or highfunctioning autism lfa, mfa, and hfa, based on iq thresholds. some people have called for an end to the terms \"highfunctioning\" and \"lowfunctioning\" due to lack of nuance and the potential for a person\\'s needs or abilities to be overlooked. about half of parents of children with asd notice their child\\'s unusual behaviors by age 18 months, and about fourfifths notice by age 24 months. according to an article, failure to meet any of the following milestones \"is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations. delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the longterm outcome\". the united states preventive services task force in 2016 found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concerns. the japanese practice is to screen all children for asd at 18 and 24 months, using autismspecific formal screening tests. in contrast, in the uk, children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened. it is not known which approach is more effective. screening tools include the modified checklist for autism in toddlers mchat, the early screening of autistic traits questionnaire, and the first year inventory initial data on mchat and its predecessor, the checklist for autism in toddlers chat, on children aged 1830 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity many falsenegatives but good specificity few falsepositives. it may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish asd from other developmental disorders. screening tools designed for one culture\\'s norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture. although genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical, it can be considered in some cases, such as children with neurological symptoms and dysmorphic features. while infection with rubella during pregnancy causes fewer than 1 of cases of autism, vaccination against rubella can prevent many of those cases. the main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase quality of life and functional independence. in general, higher iqs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes. no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child\\'s needs. families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment. services should be carried out by behavior analysts, special education teachers, speech pathologists, and licensed psychologists. studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy. however, the development of evidencebased interventions has advanced in recent years. although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment, the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options. intensive, sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire selfcare, communication, and job skills, and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated. while medications have not been found to help with core symptoms, they may be used for associated symptoms, such as irritability, inattention, or repetitive behavior patterns. educational interventions often used include applied behavior analysis aba, developmental models, structured teaching, speech and language therapy, social skills therapy, and occupational therapy and cognitive behavioral interventions in adults without intellectual disability to reduce depression, anxiety, and obsessivecompulsive disorder. among these approaches, interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively, or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit. the quality of research for early intensive behavioral intervention eibia treatment procedure incorporating over thirty hours per week of the structured type of aba that is carried out with very young childrenis currently low, and more vigorous research designs with larger sample sizes are needed. two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include structured and naturalistic aba interventions, and developmental social pragmatic models dsp. one interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model, which teaches parents how to implement various aba and dsp techniques, allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves. various dsp programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through athome parent implementation. despite the recent development of parent training models, these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies, being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment. early, intensive aba therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing communication and adaptive functioning in preschool children it is also wellestablished for improving the intellectual performance of that age group. similarly, a teacherimplemented intervention that utilizes a more naturalistic form of aba combined with a developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be beneficial in improving socialcommunication skills in young children, although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms. neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided. it is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up, and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results. the appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers. medications may be used to treat asd symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails. they may also be used for associated health problems, such as adhd or anxiety. more than half of us children diagnosed with asd are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants, with the most common drug classes being antidepressants, stimulants, and antipsychotics. the atypical antipsychotic drugs risperidone and aripiprazole are fdaapproved for treating associated aggressive and selfinjurious behaviors. however, their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits, and people with autism may respond atypically. side effects, for example, may include weight gain, tiredness, drooling, and aggression. ssri antidepressants, such as fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, have been shown to be effective in reducing repetitive and ritualistic behaviors, while the stimulant medication methylphenidate is beneficial for some children with comorbid inattentiveness or hyperactivity. there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with asd. no known medication relieves autism\\'s core symptoms of social and communication impairments. experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function, suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism. although many alternative therapies and interventions are available, few are supported by scientific studies. treatment approaches have little empirical support in qualityoflife contexts, and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and realworld relevance. some alternative treatments may place the child at risk. the preference that children with autism have for unconventional foods can lead to reduction in bone cortical thickness with this being greater in those on caseinfree diets, as a consequence of the low intake of calcium and vitamin d however, suboptimal bone development in asd has also been associated with lack of exercise and gastrointestinal disorders. in 2005, botched chelation therapy killed a fiveyearold child with autism. chelation is not recommended for people with asd since the associated risks outweigh any potential benefits. another alternative medicine practice with no evidence is cease therapy, a mixture of homeopathy, supplements, and \\'vaccine detoxing\\'. although popularly used as an alternative treatment for people with autism, as of 2018 there is no good evidence to recommend a gluten and caseinfree diet as a standard treatment. a 2018 review concluded that it may be a therapeutic option for specific groups of children with autism, such as those with known food intolerances or allergies, or with food intolerance markers. the authors analyzed the prospective trials conducted to date that studied the efficacy of the gluten and caseinfree diet in children with asd 4 in total. all of them compared gluten and caseinfree diet versus normal diet with a control group 2 doubleblind randomized controlled trials, 1 doubleblind crossover trial, 1 singleblind trial. in two of the studies, whose duration was 12 and 24 months, a significant improvement in asd symptoms efficacy rate 50 was identified. in the other two studies, whose duration was 3 months, no significant effect was observed. the authors concluded that a longer duration of the diet may be necessary to achieve the improvement of the asd symptoms. other problems documented in the trials carried out include transgressions of the diet, small sample size, the heterogeneity of the participants and the possibility of a placebo effect. in the subset of people who have gluten sensitivity there is limited evidence that suggests that a glutenfree diet may improve some autistic behaviors. results of a systematic review on interventions to address health outcomes among autistic adults found emerging evidence to support mindfulnessbased interventions for improving mental health. this includes decreasing stress, anxiety, ruminating thoughts, anger, and aggression. there is tentative evidence that music therapy may improve social interactions, verbal communication, and nonverbal communication skills. there has been early research looking at hyperbaric treatments in children with autism. studies on pet therapy have shown positive effects. there is no known cure. the degree of symptoms can decrease, occasionally to the extent that people lose their diagnosis of asd this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not. it is not known how often recovery happens reported rates in unselected samples have ranged from 3 to 25. most children with autism acquire language by age five or younger, though a few have developed communication skills in later years. many children with autism lack social support, future employment opportunities or selfdetermination. although core difficulties tend to persist, symptoms often become less severe with age. few highquality studies address longterm prognosis. some adults show modest improvement in communication skills, but a few decline no study has focused on autism after midlife. acquiring language before age six, having an iq above 50, and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes independent living is unlikely with severe autism. many individuals with autism face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood. compared to the general population individuals with autism are more likely to be unemployed and to have never had a job. about half of people in their 20s with autism are not employed. most recent reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of 12 per 1,000 for autism and close to 6 per 1,000 for asd as of 2007. a 2016 survey in the united states reported a rate of 25 per 1,000 children for asd. globally, autism affects an estimated 24.8 million people , while asperger syndrome affects a further 37.2 million. in 2012, the nhs estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the uk was 1.1. rates of pddnos\\'s has been estimated at 3.7 per 1,000, asperger syndrome at roughly 0.6 per 1,000, and childhood disintegrative disorder at 0.02 per 1,000. cdc estimates about 1 out of 59 1.7 for 2014, an increase from 1 out of every 68 children 1.5 for 2010. the number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s. this increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices, referral patterns, availability of services, age at diagnosis, and public awareness, though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out. the available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism\\'s true prevalence has increased a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics. boys are at higher risk for asd than girls. the sex ratio averages 4.31 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment it may be close to 21 with intellectual disability and more than 5.51 without. several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated, but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed one theory is that females are underdiagnosed. although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancyrelated risk factor as a cause of autism, the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent, and with diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy. the risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism. most professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism. several other conditions are common in children with autism. they include a few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. the \"table talk\" of martin luther, compiled by his notetaker, mathesius, contains the story of a 12yearold boy who may have been severely autistic. luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil, and suggested that he be suffocated, although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report. the earliest welldocumented case of autism is that of hugh blair of borgue, as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul blair\\'s marriage to gain blair\\'s inheritance. the wild boy of aveyron, a feral child caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism the medical student jean itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation. the new latin word \"autismus\" english translation \"autism\" was coined by the swiss psychiatrist eugen bleuler in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia. he derived it from the greek word \"auts\" , meaning \"self\", and used it to mean morbid selfadmiration, referring to \"autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance\". a soviet child psychiatrist, grunya sukhareva, described a similar syndrome that was published in russian in 1925, and in german in 1926. the word \"autism\" first took its modern sense in 1938 when hans asperger of the vienna university hospital adopted bleuler\\'s terminology \"autistic psychopaths\" in a lecture in german about child psychology. asperger was investigating an asd now known as asperger syndrome, though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981. leo kanner of the johns hopkins hospital first used \"autism\" in its modern sense in english when he introduced the label \"early infantile autism\" in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities. almost all the characteristics described in kanner\\'s first paper on the subject, notably \"autistic aloneness\" and \"insistence on sameness\", are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders. it is not known whether kanner derived the term independently of asperger. donald triplett was the first person diagnosed with autism. he was diagnosed by kanner after being first examined in 1938, and was labeled as \"case 1\". triplett was noted for his savant abilities, particularly being able to name musical notes played on a piano and to mentally multiply numbers. his father, oliver, described him as socially withdrawn but interested in number patterns, music notes, letters of the alphabet, and u.s. president pictures. by the age of 2, he had the ability to recite the 23rd psalm and memorized 25 questions and answers from the presbyterian catechism. he was also interested in creating musical chords. kanner\\'s reuse of \"autism\" led to decades of confused terminology like \"infantile schizophrenia\", and child psychiatry\\'s focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant\\'s response to \"refrigerator mothers\". starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome. as late as the mid1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism while in 2007 it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions. although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood asd have affected how asd is viewed, parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their child\\'s autistic behavior is perceived negatively, and many primary care physicians and medical specialists express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research. it took until 1980 for the dsmiii to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia. in 1987, the dsmiiir provided a checklist for diagnosing autism. in may 2013, the dsm5 was released, updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders. the grouping of disorders, including pddnos, autism, asperger syndrome, rett syndrome, and cdd, has been removed and replaced with the general term of autism spectrum disorders. the two categories that exist are impaired social communication andor interaction, and restricted andor repetitive behaviors. the internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find difficult to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely. societal and cultural aspects of autism have developed some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that autism is simply another way of being. an autistic culture has emerged, accompanied by the autistic rights and neurodiversity movements. events include world autism awareness day, autism sunday, autistic pride day, autreat, and others. organizations dedicated to promoting awareness of autism include autistic self advocacy network, aspies for freedom, autism national committee, and autism society of america. at the same time, some organizations, including autism speaks, have been condemned by disability rights organizations for failing to support autistic people. socialscience scholars study those with autism in hopes to learn more about \"autism as a culture, transcultural comparisons... and research on social movements.\" while most autistic individuals do not have savant skills, many have been successful in their fields. the autism rights movement is a social movement within the context of disability rights that emphasizes the concept of neurodiversity, viewing the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the human brain rather than a disorder to be cured. the autism rights movement advocates for including greater acceptance of autistic behaviors therapies that focus on coping skills rather than on imitating the behaviors of those without autism, and the recognition of the autistic community as a minority group. autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the human genome. this perspective is distinct from two other likewise distinct views the medical perspective, that autism is caused by a genetic defect and should be addressed by targeting the autism genes, and fringe theories that autism is caused by environmental factors such as vaccines. a common criticism against autistic activists is that the majority of them are \"highfunctioning\" or have asperger syndrome and do not represent the views of \"lowfunctioning\" autistic people.  about half of autistics are unemployed, and one third of those with graduate degrees may be unemployed. among autistics who find work, most are employed in sheltered settings working for wages below the national minimum. while employers state hiring concerns about productivity and supervision, experienced employers of autistics give positive reports of above average memory and detail orientation as well as a high regard for rules and procedure in autistic employees. a majority of the economic burden of autism is caused by decreased earnings in the job market. some studies also find decreased earning among parents who care for autistic children.\\n albedo albedo  , meaning \\'whiteness\\' is the measure of the diffuse reflection of solar radiation out of the total solar radiation and measured on a scale from 0, corresponding to a black body that absorbs all incident radiation, to 1, corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation. surface albedo is defined as the ratio of radiosity to the irradiance flux per unit area received by a surface. the proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the earth\\'s surface. these factors vary with atmospheric composition, geographic location and time see position of the sun. while bihemispherical reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence i.e., for a given position of the sun, albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period. the temporal resolution may range from seconds as obtained from flux measurements to daily, monthly, or annual averages. unless given for a specific wavelength spectral albedo, albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation. due to measurement constraints, it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface between 0.3 and 3 m. this spectrum includes visible light 0.40.7 m, which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark e.g., trees absorb most radiation, whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright e.g., snow reflects most radiation. albedo is an important concept in climatology, astronomy, and environmental management e.g., as part of the leadership in energy and environmental design leed program for sustainable rating of buildings. the average albedo of the earth from the upper atmosphere, its \"planetary albedo\", is 3035 because of cloud cover, but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features. the term albedo was introduced into optics by johann heinrich lambert in his 1760 work \"photometria\". any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body. when seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4. the average albedo of earth is about 0.3. this is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds. earth\\'s surface albedo is regularly estimated via earth observation satellite sensors such as nasa\\'s modis instruments on board the terra and aqua satellites, and the ceres instrument on the suomi npp and jpss. as the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite, not all directions, a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directionalhemispherical reflectance and bihemispherical reflectance e.g.,. these calculations are based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function brdf, which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle. bdrf can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo. earth\\'s average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about 15c. if earth were frozen entirely and hence be more reflective, the average temperature of the planet would drop below 40c. if only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0c. in contrast, if the entire earth was covered by water  a socalled ocean planet  the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost 27c. for land surfaces, it has been shown that the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle \"\" can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms with formula3 being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle, and formula4 being the proportion of diffuse illumination, the actual albedo formula5 also called bluesky albedo can then be given as this formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface. the albedos of planets, satellites and minor planets such as asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties. the study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle \"phase angle\", and variation in time composes a major part of the astronomical field of photometry. for small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. for example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids. enceladus, a moon of saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the solar system, with an albedo of 0.99. another notable highalbedo body is eris, with an albedo of 0.96. many small objects in the outer solar system and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about 0.05. a typical comet nucleus has an albedo of 0.04. such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds. the overall albedo of the moon is measured to be around 0.14, but it is strongly directional and nonlambertian, displaying also a strong opposition effect. although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodies. two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the vband geometric albedo measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer and the bond albedo measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected. their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion. in detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five hapke parameters which semiempirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle, including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces. the correlation between astronomical geometric albedo, absolute magnitude and diameter is formula7, where formula8 is the astronomical albedo, formula9 is the diameter in kilometers, and formula10 is the absolute magnitude. albedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light, except in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the earth\\'s surface at that location e.g. through melting of reflective ice. that said, albedo and illumination both vary by latitude. albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics, with a local maximum in the tropics. the intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation solar irradiance high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation, whereas areas such as the sahara desert, which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation. tropical and subtropical rainforest areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts, which have lower insolation. because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes. arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb, effectively cooling the earth. this has been a concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures, creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker being water or ground which is darker color and reflects less heat back into space. this feedback loop results in a reduced albedo effect. albedo affects climate by determining how much radiation a planet absorbs. the uneven heating of earth from albedo variations between land, ice, or ocean surfaces can drive weather. when an area\\'s albedo changes due to snowfall, a snowtemperature feedback results. a layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. in principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area e.g., a warm air mass, the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snowtemperature feedback. however, because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight higher insolation cause melting. when the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass or soil, the effect is reversed the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating. snow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow. over antarctica snow albedo averages a little more than 0.8. if a marginally snowcovered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack the icealbedo positive feedback. just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow, the albedo of snowcovered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water. sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow. when sea ice melts, either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above, the snowcovered surface is reduced, and more surface of sea water is exposed, so the rate of energy absorption increases. the extra absorbed energy heats the sea water, which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts. as with the preceding example of snowmelt, the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback. both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important for global warming. cryoconite, powdery windblown dust containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets. the dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback, together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo, can lead to large errors in energy estimates. because of this, in order to reduce the error of energy estimates, it is important to measure the albedo of snowcovered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions. albedo works on a smaller scale, too. in sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and lightcoloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing. albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices. for example, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon asih and crystalline silicon csibased compared to traditional spectralintegrated albedo predictions. research showed impacts of over 10. more recently, the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials both humanmade and natural and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies industrial solar farms, commercial flat rooftops and residential pitchedroof applications. because forests generally have a low albedo, the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis, some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation. in the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect. trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through evapotranspiration. the water vapor causes cooling on the land surface, causes heating where it condenses, acts a strong greenhouse gas, and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds. scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact, and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate. in seasonally snowcovered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10 to 50 higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. deciduous trees have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas coniferous trees have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15. variation in summer albedo across both forest types is correlated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display a greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy. the result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be reflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy. studies by the hadley centre have investigated the relative generally warming effect of albedo change and cooling effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests. they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes e.g., siberia were neutral or perhaps warming. water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. the reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the fresnel equations see graph. at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner not diffusely. the glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. at small angles of incident light, waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivityvs.incidentangle curve and a locally increased average incident angle. although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of earth near the terminator early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles. however, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light. note that white caps on waves look white and have high albedo because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. fresh \\'black\\' ice exhibits fresnel reflection. snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to 0.9. cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. \"on any given day, about half of earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth.\" albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic. a study following the burning of the kuwaiti oil fields during iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10c colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies. aerosols very fine particlesdroplets in the atmosphere have both direct and indirect effects on earth\\'s radiative balance. the direct albedo effect is generally to cool the planet the indirect effect the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties is less certain. as per spracklen et al. the effects are another albedorelated effect on the climate is from black carbon particles. the size of this effect is difficult to quantify the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is 0.2 w m, with a range 0.1 to 0.4 w m. black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo. human activities e.g., deforestation, farming, and urbanization change the albedo of various areas around the globe. however, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult, further study is required to determine anthropogenic effects. singlescattering albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. it depends on properties of the material refractive index the size of the particle or particles and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.\\n a a or a is the first letter and the first vowel letter of the modern english alphabet and the iso basic latin alphabet. its name in english is \"a\" pronounced , plural \"aes\". it is similar in shape to the ancient greek letter alpha, from which it derives. the uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. the lowercase version can be written in two forms the doublestorey a and singlestorey . the latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in italic type. in the english grammar, \"a\", and its variant \"an\", are indefinite articles. the earliest certain ancestor of \"a\" is aleph also written \\'aleph, the first letter of the phoenician alphabet, which consisted entirely of consonants for that reason, it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from a true alphabet. in turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in protosinaitic script influenced by egyptian hieroglyphs, styled as a triangular head with two horns extended. by 1600 bc, the phoenician alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms. its name is thought to have corresponded closely to the paleohebrew or arabic aleph. when the ancient greeks adopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter to represent the glottal stopthe consonant sound that the letter denoted in phoenician and other semitic languages, and that was the first phoneme of the phoenician pronunciation of the letterso they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel , and called it by the similar name of alpha. in the earliest greek inscriptions after the greek dark ages, dating to the 8th century bc, the letter rests upon its side, but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set. the etruscans brought the greek alphabet to their civilization in the italian peninsula and left the letter unchanged. the romans later adopted the etruscan alphabet to write the latin language, and the resulting letter was preserved in the latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages, including english. during roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter \"a\". first was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other \"permanent\" media. there was also a cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces. due to the \"perishable\" nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as majuscule cursive, minuscule cursive, and semicursive minuscule. variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles. the known variants include the early semiuncial, the uncial, and the later semiuncial. at the end of the roman empire 5th century ad, several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through western europe. among these were the semicursive minuscule of italy, the merovingian script in france, the visigothic script in spain, and the insular or angloirish semiuncial or anglosaxon majuscule of great britain. by the 9th century, the caroline script, which was very similar to the presentday form, was the principal form used in bookmaking, before the advent of the printing press. this form was derived through a combining of prior forms. 15thcentury italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today. these variants, the \"italic\" and \"roman\" forms, were derived from the caroline script version. the italic form, also called \"script a,\" is used in most current handwriting and consists of a circle and vertical stroke. this slowly developed from the fifthcentury form resembling the greek letter tau in the hands of medieval irish and english writers. the roman form is used in most printed material it consists of a small loop with an arc over it \"a\". both derive from the majuscule capital form. in greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. many fonts then made the right leg vertical. in some of these, the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form. italic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest set in roman type. there are some other cases aside from italic type where \"script a\" \"\", also called latin alpha, is used in contrast with latin \"a\" such as in the international phonetic alphabet. in modern english orthography, the letter represents at least seven different vowel sounds the double sequence does not occur in native english words, but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as \"aaron\" and \"aardvark\". however, occurs in many common digraphs, all with their own sound or sounds, particularly , , , , and . in most languages that use the latin alphabet, denotes an open unrounded vowel, such as , , or . an exception is saanich, in which and the glyph  stands for a closemid front unrounded vowel . in phonetic and phonemic notation in algebra, the letter \"a\" along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities, whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet \"x\", \"y\", \"z\" are used to denote unknown quantities. in geometry, capital a, b, c etc. are used to denote segments, lines, rays, etc. a capital a is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a triangle, the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle a. \"a\" is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status a, a or a, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students\\' schoolwork \"a grade\" for clean restaurants alist celebrities, etc. such associations can have a motivating effect, as exposure to the letter a has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters. \"a\" is used as a prefix on some words, such as asymmetry, to mean \"not\" or \"without\" from greek. in english grammar, \"a\", and its variant \"an\", is an indefinite article. finally, the letter a is used to denote size, as in a narrow size shoe, or a small cup size in a brassiere.\\n alabama alabama  is a state in the southeastern region of the united states. it is bordered by tennessee to the north, georgia to the east, florida and the gulf of mexico to the south, and mississippi to the west. alabama is the 30th largest by area and the 24thmost populous of the u.s. states. with a total of of inland waterways, alabama has among the most of any state. alabama is nicknamed the \"yellowhammer state\", after the state bird. alabama is also known as the \"heart of dixie\" and the \"cotton state\". the state tree is the longleaf pine, and the state flower is the camellia. alabama\\'s capital is montgomery. the largest city by population is birmingham, which has long been the most industrialized city the largest city by land area is huntsville. the oldest city is mobile, founded by french colonists in 1702 as the capital of french louisiana. greater birmingham is alabama\\'s largest urban economy, its most populous urban area, and its economic center. from the american civil war until world war ii, alabama, like many states in the southern u.s., suffered economic hardship, in part because of its continued dependence on agriculture. similar to other former slave states, alabamian legislators employed jim crow laws to disenfranchise and otherwise discriminate against african americans from the end of the reconstruction era up until at least the 1970s. despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, white rural interests dominated the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s. during this time, urban interests and african americans were markedly underrepresented. following world war ii, alabama grew as the state\\'s economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests. the state\\'s economy in the 21st century is based on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology. the europeanamerican naming of the alabama river and state was derived from the alabama people, a muskogeanspeaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the coosa and tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river. in the alabama language, the word for a person of alabama lineage is \"albaamo\" or variously \"albaama\" or \"albamo\" in different dialects the plural form is \"albaamaha\". the suggestion that \"alabama\" was borrowed from the choctaw language is unlikely. the word\\'s spelling varies significantly among historical sources. the first usage appears in three accounts of the hernando de soto expedition of 1540 garcilaso de la vega used \"alibamo\", while the knight of elvas and rodrigo ranjel wrote \"alibamu\" and \"limamu\", respectively, in transliterations of the term. as early as 1702, the french called the tribe the \"alibamon\", with french maps identifying the river as \"rivire des alibamons\". other spellings of the name have included \"alibamu\", \"alabamo\", \"albama\", \"alebamon\", \"alibama\", \"alibamou\", \"alabamu\", \"allibamou\". sources disagree on the word\\'s meaning. some scholars suggest the word comes from the choctaw \"alba\" meaning \"plants\" or \"weeds\" and \"amo\" meaning \"to cut\", \"to trim\", or \"to gather\". the meaning may have been \"clearers of the thicket\" or \"herb gatherers\", referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants. the state has numerous place names of native american origin. however, there are no correspondingly similar words in the alabama language. an 1842 article in the \"jacksonville republican\" proposed it meant \"here we rest.\" this notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of alexander beaufort meek. experts in the muskogean languages have not found any evidence to support such a translation. indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of european colonization. trade with the northeastern tribes by the ohio river began during the burial mound period 1000bce700ce and continued until european contact. the agrarian mississippian culture covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 ce, with one of its major centers built at what is now the moundville archaeological site in moundville, alabama. this is the secondlargest complex of the classic middle mississippian era, after cahokia in presentday illinois, which was the center of the culture. analysis of artifacts from archaeological excavations at moundville were the basis of scholars\\' formulating the characteristics of the southeastern ceremonial complex secc. contrary to popular belief, the secc appears to have no direct links to mesoamerican culture, but developed independently. the ceremonial complex represents a major component of the religion of the mississippian peoples it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood. among the historical tribes of native american people living in presentday alabama at the time of european contact were the cherokee, an iroquoian language people and the muskogeanspeaking alabama \"alibamu\", chickasaw, choctaw, creek, and koasati. while part of the same large language family, the muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages. with exploration in the 16th century, the spanish were the first europeans to reach alabama. the expedition of hernando de soto passed through mabila and other parts of the state in 1540. more than 160 years later, the french founded the region\\'s first european settlement at old mobile in 1702. the city was moved to the current site of mobile in 1711. this area was claimed by the french from 1702 to 1763 as part of la louisiane. after the french lost to the british in the seven years\\' war, it became part of british west florida from 1763 to 1783. after the united states victory in the american revolutionary war, the territory was divided between the united states and spain. the latter retained control of this western territory from 1783 until the surrender of the spanish garrison at mobile to u.s. forces on april 13, 1813. thomas bassett, a loyalist to the british monarchy during the revolutionary era, was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside mobile. he settled in the tombigbee district during the early 1770s. the district\\'s boundaries were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the tombigbee river and included portions of what is today southern clarke county, northernmost mobile county, and most of washington county. what is now the counties of baldwin and mobile became part of spanish west florida in 1783, part of the independent republic of west florida in 1810, and was finally added to the mississippi territory in 1812. most of what is now the northern twothirds of alabama was known as the yazoo lands beginning during the british colonial period. it was claimed by the province of georgia from 1767 onwards. following the revolutionary war, it remained a part of georgia, although heavily disputed. with the exception of the area around mobile and the yazoo lands, what is now the lower onethird of alabama was made part of the mississippi territory when it was organized in 1798. the yazoo lands were added to the territory in 1804, following the yazoo land scandal. spain kept a claim on its former spanish west florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the adamsons treaty officially ceded it to the united states in 1819. before mississippi\\'s admission to statehood on december 10, 1817, the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the alabama territory. the united states congress created the alabama territory on march 3, 1817. st. stephens, now abandoned, served as the territorial capital from 1817 to 1819. alabama was admitted as the 22nd state on december 14, 1819, with congress selecting huntsville as the site for the first constitutional convention. from july5 to august 2, 1819, delegates met to prepare the new state constitution. huntsville served as temporary capital from 1819 to 1820, when the seat of government moved to cahaba in dallas county. cahaba, now a ghost town, was the first permanent state capital from 1820 to 1825. the alabama fever land rush was underway when the state was admitted to the union, with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation. part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s, its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men. southeastern planters and traders from the upper south brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in alabama expanded. the economy of the central black belt named for its dark, productive soil was built around large cotton plantations whose owners\\' wealth grew mainly from slave labor. the area also drew many poor, disfranchised people who became subsistence farmers. alabama had an estimated population of under 10,000 people in 1810, but it increased to more than 300,000 people by 1830. most native american tribes were completely removed from the state within a few years of the passage of the indian removal act by congress in 1830. from 1826 to 1846, tuscaloosa served as alabama\\'s capital. on january 30, 1846, the alabama legislature announced it had voted to move the capital city from tuscaloosa to montgomery. the first legislative session in the new capital met in december 1847. a new capitol building was erected under the direction of stephen decatur button of philadelphia. the first structure burned down in 1849, but was rebuilt on the same site in 1851. this second capitol building in montgomery remains to the present day. it was designed by barachias holt of exeter, maine. by 1860, the population had increased to 964,201 people, of which nearly half, 435,080, were enslaved african americans, and 2,690 were free people of color. on january 11, 1861, alabama declared its secession from the union. after remaining an independent republic for a few days, it joined the confederate states of america. the confederacy\\'s capital was initially at montgomery. alabama was heavily involved in the american civil war. although comparatively few battles were fought in the state, alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the war effort. a company of cavalry soldiers from huntsville, alabama, joined nathan bedford forrest\\'s battalion in hopkinsville, kentucky. the company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves, collar and coat tails. this led to them being greeted with \"yellowhammer\", and the name later was applied to all alabama troops in the confederate army. alabama\\'s slaves were freed by the 13th amendment in 1865. alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in may 1865 until its official restoration to the union in 1868. from 1867 to 1874, with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised, many african americans emerged as political leaders in the state. alabama was represented in congress during this period by three africanamerican congressmen jeremiah haralson, benjamin s. turner, and james t. rapier. following the war, the state remained chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton. during reconstruction, state legislators ratified a new state constitution in 1868 which created the state\\'s first public school system and expanded women\\'s rights. legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects, although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation. organized insurgent, resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and republicans. besides the shortlived original ku klux klan, these included the pale faces, knights of the white camellia, red shirts, and the white league. reconstruction in alabama ended in 1874, when the democrats regained control of the legislature and governor\\'s office through an election dominated by fraud and violence. they wrote another constitution in 1875, and the legislature passed the blaine amendment, prohibiting public money from being used to finance religiousaffiliated schools. the same year, legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools. railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891. after disenfranchising most african americans and many poor whites in the 1901 constitution, the alabama legislature passed more jim crow laws at the beginning of the 20th century to impose segregation in everyday life. the new 1901 constitution of alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population, including nearly all african americans and native americans, and tens of thousands of poor whites, through making voter registration difficult, requiring a poll tax and literacy test. the 1901 constitution required racial segregation of public schools. by 1903, only 2,980 african americans were registered in alabama, although at least 74,000 were literate. this compared to more than 181,000 african americans eligible to vote in 1900. the numbers dropped even more in later decades. the state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the 1950s jails were segregated in 1911 hospitals in 1915 toilets, hotels, and restaurants in 1928 and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945. while the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting, the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well, due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax. by 1941, whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws 600,000 whites vs. 520,000 africanamericans. nearly all african americans had lost the ability to vote. despite numerous legal challenges which succeeded in overturning certain provisions, the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement. the exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens. the ruraldominated alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised african americans, but it did not relieve them of paying taxes. partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for african americans in the south, the rosenwald fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as rosenwald schools. in alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with rosenwald funds, which paid onethird of the construction costs. the fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest. black residents effectively taxed themselves twice, by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools, which were built in many rural areas. they often donated land and labor as well. beginning in 1913, the first 80 rosenwald schools were built in alabama for africanamerican children. a total of 387 schools, seven teachers\\' houses, and several vocational buildings were completed by 1937 in the state. several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the national register of historic places. continued racial discrimination and lynchings, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of african americans from rural alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the great migration out of the south. reflecting this emigration, the population growth rate in alabama see \"historical populations\" table below dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920. at the same time, many rural people migrated to the city of birmingham to work in new industrial jobs. birmingham experienced such rapid growth it was called the \"magic city\". by 1920, birmingham was the 36thlargest city in the united states. heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy. its residents were underrepresented for decades in the state legislature, which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes, as it was required by the state constitution. this did not change until the late 1960s following a lawsuit and court order. industrial development related to the demands of world war ii brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war. rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living. one example of this massive influx of workers occurred in mobile. between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into the city to work for warrelated industries. cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base. despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the ruraldominated legislature refused to reapportion house and senate seats based on population, as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses. they held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. one result was that jefferson county, containing birmingham\\'s industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than onethird of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services. urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature. a 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, \"a minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the alabama legislature.\" in the united states supreme court cases of \"baker v. carr\" 1962 and \"reynolds v. sims\" 1964, the court ruled that the principle of \"one man, one vote\" needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures, and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties. in 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census. this benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than sixty years. other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts. african americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement, including legal challenges. in 1954, the u.s. supreme court ruled in \"brown v. board of education\" that public schools had to be desegregated, but alabama was slow to comply. during the 1960s, under governor george wallace, alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation. the civil rights movement had notable events in alabama, including the montgomery bus boycott 195556, freedom rides in 1961, and 1965 selma to montgomery marches. these contributed to congressional passage and enactment of the civil rights act of 1964 and voting rights act of 1965 by the u.s. congress. legal segregation ended in the states in 1964, but jim crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court. according to \"the new york times\", by 2017, many of alabama\\'s africanamericans were living in alabama\\'s cities such as birmingham and montgomery. also, the black belt region across central alabama \"is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly africanamerican. these counties include dallas, lowndes, marengo and perry.\" alabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation. in the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, \"dillard v. crenshaw county\", challenged the atlarge voting for representative seats of 180 alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards. atlarge voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. despite african americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the atlarge jurisdictions. as part of settlement of this case, five alabama cities and counties, including chilton county, adopted a system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multiseat jurisdictions. this has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. in another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in conecuh county. in 1982, limited voting was first tested in conecuh county. together use of these systems has increased the number of african americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens. alabama is the thirtiethlargest state in the united states with of total area 3.2 of the area is water, making alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water, also giving it the secondlargest inland waterway system in the united states. about threefifths of the land area is a gentle plain with a general descent towards the

rivers rickwood caverns near warrior features an underground pool, blind cave fish and 260 million year old limestone formations and the walls of jericho canyon on the alabamatennessee state line. a wide meteorite impact crater is located in elmore county, just north of montgomery. this is the wetumpka crater, the site of \"alabama\\'s greatest natural disaster\". a wide meteorite hit the area about 80 million years ago. the hills just east of downtown wetumpka showcase the eroded remains of the impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock, with the area labeled the wetumpka crater or astrobleme \"starwound\" because of the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock that can be found beneath the surface. in 2002, christian koeberl with the institute of geochemistry university of vienna published evidence and established the site as the 157th recognized impact crater on earth. the state is classified as humid subtropical \"cfa\" under the koppen climate

to statistics from the national climatic data center for the period january 1, 1950, to june 2013. several longtracked f5ef5 tornadoes have contributed to alabama reporting more tornado fatalities since 1950 than any other state. the state was affected by the 1974 super outbreak and was devastated tremendously by the 2011 super outbreak. the 2011 super outbreak produced a record amount of tornadoes in the state. the tally reached 62. the peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state. alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary

demographers estimate that 2023 of people in alabama are of predominantly english ancestry and the figure is likely higher. in the 1980 census, 41 of the people in alabama identified as being of english ancestry, making them the largest ethnic group at the time. based on historic migration and settlement patterns in the southern colonies and states, demographers estimated there are more people in alabama of scotsirish origins than selfreported. many people in alabama claim irish ancestry because of the term scotsirish but, based on historic immigration and settlement, their ancestors were more likely protestant scotsirish coming from northern ireland, where they had been for a few generations as part of the english colonization. the scotsirish were the largest nonenglish immigrant group from the british isles before the american revolution, and many settled in the south, later moving into the deep south as it was developed. in 1984, under the davisstrong act, the state legislature established the alabama indian affairs commission. native american groups within the state had increasingly been demanding recognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination. given the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation, the native american peoples, who have sometimes been of mixed race, have insisted on having their cultural identification respected. in the past, their selfidentification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black. the state has officially recognized nine american indian tribes in the state, descended mostly from the five civilized tribes of the american southeast. these are the following. the state government has promoted recognition of native american contributions to the state, including the designation in 2000 for columbus day to be jointly celebrated as american indian heritage day. most alabama residents 95.1 of those five

alabama\\'s government is the alabama constitution, which was ratified in 1901. at almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is by some accounts the world\\'s longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the united states constitution. there has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize alabama\\'s constitution. critics argue that alabama\\'s constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature, leaving practically no power in local hands. most counties do not have home rule. any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. one criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism. alabama\\'s government is divided into three coequal branches. the legislative branch is the alabama legislature, a bicameral assembly composed of the alabama house of representatives, with 105 members, and the alabama senate, with 35 members. the legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. the republican party currently holds a majority in both houses of the legislature. the legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority most state legislatures require a twothirds majority to override a veto. until 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. it had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901 as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. it had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. in \"reynolds v. sims\" 1964, the u.s. supreme court implemented the principle of \"one man, one vote\", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented. further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems. at that time, alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. this had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. for instance, birmingham and jefferson county taxes had supplied onethird of the state budget, but jefferson county received only 167th of state services in funding. through the legislative delegations, the alabama legislature kept control of county governments. the executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. it is headed by the governor of alabama. other members of executive branch include the cabinet, the lieutenant governor of alabama, the attorney general of alabama, the alabama secretary of state, the alabama state treasurer, and the state auditor of alabama. the current governor is republican kay ivey. the members of the legislature take office immediately after the november elections. statewide officials, such as the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and other constitutional officers, take office the following january. the judicial branch is responsible for interpreting the state\\'s constitution and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. the state\\'s highest court is the supreme court of alabama. alabama uses partisan elections to select judges. since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized. the current chief justice of the alabama supreme court is republican tom parker. all sitting justices on the alabama supreme court are members of the republican party. there are two intermediate appellate courts, the court of civil appeals and the court of criminal appeals, and four trial courts the circuit court trial court of general jurisdiction, and the district, probate, and municipal courts. some critics believe the election of judges has contributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions. alabama has the highest per capita death penalty rate in the country. in some years, it imposes more death sentences than does texas, a state which has a population five times larger. however, executions per capita are significantly higher in texas. some of its cases have been highly controversial the supreme court has overturned 24 convictions in death penalty cases. it was the only state to allow judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use a death sentence in 10 cases judges overturned sentences of life imprisonment without parole lwop that were voted unanimously by juries. this judicial authority was removed in april 2017. taxes are collected by the alabama department of revenue. alabama levies a 2, 4, or5 percent personal income tax, depending on the amount earned and filing status. taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their alabama state tax, even if taking the standard deduction those who itemize can also deduct fica the social security and medicare tax. the state\\'s general sales tax rate is 4. sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases. for example, the total sales tax rate in mobile is 10 and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1, which means a diner in mobile would pay an 11 tax on a meal. , sales and excise taxes in alabama account for 51 of all state and local revenue, compared with an average of about 36 nationwide. alabama is one of seven states that levy a tax on food at the same rate as other goods, and one of two states the other being neighboring mississippi which fully taxes groceries without any offsetting relief for lowincome families. most states exempt groceries from sales tax or apply a lower tax rate. alabama\\'s income tax on poor working families is among the highest in the u.s. alabama is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as 4,600, which is barely onequarter the federal poverty line. alabama\\'s threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the district of columbia with income taxes. the corporate income tax rate is currently 6.5. the overall federal, state, and local tax burden in alabama ranks the state as the second least taxburdened state in the country. property taxes are the lowest in the u.s. the current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes. since alabama\\'s tax structure largely depends on consumer spending, it is subject to high variable budget structure. for example, in 2003, alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as 670 million. alabama has 67 counties. each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. it also has limited executive authority in the county. because of the constraints of the alabama constitution, which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties jefferson, lee, mobile, madison, montgomery, shelby, and tuscaloosa in the state have limited home rule. instead, most counties in the state must lobby the local legislation committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning. the state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties, as recommended by the 1973 alabama constitutional commission. legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. united states supreme court decisions in \"baker v. carr\" 1964 required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, in order to implement the principle of \"one man, one vote\". before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to underrepresentation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. the rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas. \"the lack of home rule for counties in alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. alabama\\'s constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost onethird of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. a significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.\" alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state, meaning the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. the alabama alcoholic beverage control board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state. twentyfive of the 67 counties are \"dry counties\" which ban the sale of alcohol, and there are many dry municipalities even in counties which permit alcohol sales. during reconstruction following the american civil war, alabama was occupied by federal troops of the third military district under general john pope. in 1874, the political coalition of white democrats known as the redeemers took control of the state government from the republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation. after 1890, a coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise african american residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor whites. by 1941 more whites than blacks had been disenfranchised 600,000 to 520,000. the total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law. from 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. as counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly threequarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation. alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement, when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. governor george wallace, the state\\'s only fourterm governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. only after passage of the federal civil rights act of 1964 and voting rights act of 1965 did african americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. in many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by atlarge electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish singlemember districts that enable a more diverse representation among county boards. in 2007, the alabama legislature passed, and republican governor bob riley signed a resolution expressing \"profound regret\" over slavery and its lingering impact. in a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the alabama state capitol, which housed congress of the confederate states of america. in 2010, republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years. , there are a total of 3,326,812 registered voters, with 2,979,576 active, and the others inactive in the state. with the disfranchisement of blacks in 1901, the state became part of the \"solid south\", a system in which the democratic party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every southern state. for nearly a hundred years local and state elections in alabama were decided in the democratic party primary, with generally only token republican challengers running in the general election. since the mid to late 20th century, however, white conservatives started shifting to the republican party. in alabama, majoritywhite districts are now expected to regularly elect republican candidates to federal, state and local office. members of the nine seats on the supreme court of alabama and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. until 1994, no republicans held any of the court seats. in that general election, the thenincumbent chief justice, ernest c. hornsby, refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to republican perry o. hooper, sr.. hornsby sued alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. this ultimately led to a collapse of support for democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. the democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in august 2011 with the resignation of the last democrat on the bench. in the early 21st century, republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices. republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the alabama state board of education. in 2010, republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. the last remaining statewide democrat, who served on the alabama public service commission was defeated in 2012. only three republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of reconstruction, when republicans generally represented reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise. the three gop lieutenant governors are steve windom 19992003, kay ivey 20112017, and will ainsworth 2019present. many local offices county commissioners, boards of education, tax assessors, tax collectors, etc. in the state are still held by democrats. many rural counties have voters who are majority democrats, resulting in local elections being decided in the democratic primary. similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majorityrepublican and elections are effectively decided in the republican primary, although there are exceptions. alabama\\'s 67 county sheriffs are elected in partisan, atlarge races, and democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts. the current split is 35 democrats, 31 republicans, and one independent fayette. however, most of the democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties. the majority of republican sheriffs have been elected in the more urbansuburban and heavily populated counties. , the state of alabama has one female sheriff, in morgan county, alabama, and ten africanamerican sheriffs. the state\\'s two u.s. senators are republican richard c. shelby and democrat doug jones. shelby was originally elected to the senate as a democrat in 1986 and reelected in 1992, but switched parties immediately following the november 1994 general election. in the u.s. house of representatives, the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are republicans bradley byrne, mike d. rogers, robert aderholt, morris j. brooks, martha roby, and gary palmer and one democrat terri sewell who represents the black belt as well as most of the predominantly black portions of birmingham, tuscaloosa and montgomery. public primary and secondary education in alabama is under the

proficiency under the national no child left behind law, using measures determined by the state of alabama. while alabama\\'s public education system has improved in recent decades, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. according to u.s. census data 2000, alabama\\'s high school graduation rate 75 is the fourth lowest in the u.s. after kentucky, louisiana and mississippi. the largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees. generally prohibited in the west at large, school corporal punishment is not unusual in alabama, with 27,260 public school students paddled at least one time, according to government data for the 20112012 school year. the rate of school corporal punishment in alabama is surpassed only by mississippi

homer\\'s \"iliad\". he was the son of the nereid thetis and peleus, king of phthia. achilles\\' most notable feat during the trojan war was the slaying of the trojan prince hector outside the gates of troy. although the death of achilles is not presented in the \"iliad\", other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the trojan war by paris, who shot him in the heel with an arrow. later legends beginning with statius\\' unfinished epic \"achilleid\", written in the 1st century ad state that achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel because, when his mother thetis dipped him in the river styx as an infant, she held him by one of his heels. alluding to these legends, the term \"achilles\\' heel\" has come to mean a point of weakness, especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution. the achilles tendon is also named after him due to these legends. linear b tablets attest to the personal name \"achilleus\" in the forms \"akireu\" and \"akirewe\", the latter being the dative of the former. the name grew more popular, even becoming common soon after the seventh century bc and was also turned into the female form  \"achillea\", attested in attica in the fourth century bc ig ii 1617 and, in the form \"achillia\", on a stele in halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an \"amazon\". achilles\\' name can be analyzed as a combination of \\' \"distress, pain, sorrow, grief\" and \\' \"people, soldiers, nation\", resulting in a protoform \"akhluos\" \"he who has the people distressed\" or \"he whose people have distress\". the grief or distress of the people is a theme raised numerous times in the \"iliad\" and frequently by achilles himself. achilles\\' role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of \"\" \"glory\", usually in war. furthermore, \"las\" has been construed by gregory nagy, following leonard palmer, to mean \"a corps of soldiers\", a muster. with this derivation, the name obtains a double meaning in the poem when the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring distress to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. the poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership. another etymology relates the name to a protoindoeuropean compound \"hepds\" \"sharp foot\" which first gave an illyrian \"kpedis\", evolving through time into \"khpdes\" and then \"akhiddes\". the shift from \"dd\" to \"ll\" is then ascribed to the passing of the name into greek via a pregreek source. the first root part \"he\" \"sharp, pointed\" also gave greek  \"ak\" \"point, silence, healing\",  \"akm\" \"point, edge, zenith\" and  \"oxs\" \"sharp, pointed, keen, quick, clever\", whereas  stems from the root \"heg\" \"to be upset, afraid\". the whole expression would be comparable to the latin \"acupedius\" \"swift of foot\". compare also the latin word family of \"acis\" \"sharp edge or point, battle line, battle, engagement\", \"acus\" \"needle, pin, bodkin\", and \"acu\" \"to make pointed, sharpen, whet to exercise to arouse\" whence \"acute\". some topical epitheta of achilles in the \"iliad\" point to this \"swiftfootedness\", namely    \"podrks dos achilles\" \"swiftfooted divine achilles\" or, even more frequently,    \"pdas ks achilles\" \"quickfooted achilles\". some researchers deem the name a loan word, possibly from a pregreek language. achilles\\' descent from the nereid thetis and a similarity of his name with those of river deities such as acheron and achelous have led to speculations about him being an old water divinity see below worship. robert s. p. beekes has suggested a pregreek origin of the name, based among other things on the coexistence of \"\" and \"\" in epic language, which may account for a palatalized phoneme l in the original language. achilles was the son of the nereid thetis and of peleus, the king of the myrmidons. zeus and poseidon had been rivals for the hand of thetis until prometheus, the forethinker, warned zeus of a prophecy originally uttered by themis, goddess of divine law that thetis would bear a son greater than his father. for this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed peleus. there is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events in the \"argonautica\" 4.760 zeus\\' sister and wife hera alludes to thetis\\' chaste resistance to the advances of zeus, pointing out that thetis was so loyal to hera\\'s marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods. thetis, although a daughter of the seagod nereus, was also brought up by hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of zeus. zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal. according to the \"achilleid\", written by statius in the 1st century ad, and to nonsurviving previous sources, when achilles was born thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river styx however, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him his left heel see achilles\\' heel, achilles\\' tendon. it is not clear if this version of events was known earlier. in another version of this story, thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire in order to burn away the mortal parts of his body. she was interrupted by peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage. none of the sources before statius make any reference to this general invulnerability. to the contrary, in the \"iliad\" homer mentions achilles being wounded in book 21 the paeonian hero asteropaeus, son of pelagon, challenged achilles by the river scamander. he cast two spears at once, one grazed achilles\\' elbow, \"drawing a spurt of blood\". also, in the fragmentary poems of the epic cycle in which one can find description of the hero\\'s death i.e. the \"cypria\", the \"little iliad\" by lesches of pyrrha, the \"aithiopis\" and \"iliou persis\" by arctinus of miletus, there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel in the later vase paintings presenting the death of achilles, the arrow or in many cases, arrows hit his torso. peleus entrusted achilles to chiron the centaur, on mount pelion, to be reared. thetis foretold that her son\\'s fate was either to gain glory and die young, or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity. achilles chose the former, and decided to take part in the trojan war. according to homer, achilles grew up in phthia together with his companion patroclus. according to photius, the sixth book of the \"new history\" by ptolemy hephaestion reported that thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by peleus but when she had achilles, peleus noticed, tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot, and confided him to the centaur chiron. later chiron exhumed the body of the damysus, who was the fastest of all the giants, removed the ankle, and incorporated it into achilles\\' burnt foot. among the appellations under which achilles is generally known are the following some posthomeric sources claim that in order to keep achilles safe from the war, thetis or, in some versions, peleus hid the young man at the court of lycomedes, king of skyros. there, achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among lycomedes\\' daughters, perhaps under the name \"pyrrha\" the redhaired girl. with lycomedes\\' daughter deidamia, whom in the account of statius he rapes, achilles there fathers a son, neoptolemus also called pyrrhus, after his father\\'s possible alias. according to this story, odysseus learns from the prophet calchas that the achaeans would be unable to capture troy without achilles\\' aid. odysseus goes to skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women\\'s clothes and jewellery and places a shield and spear among his goods. when achilles instantly takes up the spear, odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the greek campaign. in another version of the story, odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with lycomedes\\' women while the women flee in panic, achilles prepares to defend the court, thus giving his identity away. according to the \"iliad\", achilles arrived at troy with 50 ships, each carrying 50 myrmidons. he appointed five leaders each leader commanding 500 myrmidons menesthius, eudorus, peisander, phoenix and alcimedon. when the greeks left for the trojan war, they accidentally stopped in mysia, ruled by king telephus. in the resulting battle, achilles gave telephus a wound that would not heal telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that \"he that wounded shall heal\". guided by the oracle, he arrived at argos, where achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to troy. according to other reports in euripides\\' lost play about telephus, he went to aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked achilles to heal his wound. achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge. alternatively, telephus held orestes for ransom, the ransom being achilles\\' aid in healing the wound. odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound therefore, the spear must be able to heal it. pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and telephus was healed. according to the \"cypria\" the part of the epic cycle that tells the events of the trojan war before achilles\\' wrath, when the achaeans desired to return home, they were restrained by achilles, who afterwards attacked the cattle of aeneas, sacked neighbouring cities like pedasus and lyrnessus, where the greeks capture the queen briseis and killed tenes, a son of apollo, as well as priam\\'s son troilus in the sanctuary of apollo thymbraios however, the romance between troilus and chryseis described in geoffrey chaucer\\'s \"troilus and criseyde\" and in william shakespeare\\'s \"troilus and cressida\" is a medieval invention. in dares phrygius\\' \"account of the destruction of troy\", the latin summary through which the story of achilles was transmitted to medieval europe, as well as in older accounts, troilus was a young trojan prince, the youngest of king priam\\'s and hecuba\\'s five legitimate sons or according other sources, another son of apollo. despite his youth, he was one of the main trojan war leaders, a \"horse fighter\" or \"chariot fighter\" according to homer. prophecies linked troilus\\' fate to that of troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him. yet achilles, struck by the beauty of both troilus and his sister polyxena, and overcome with lust, directed his sexual attentions on the youth who, refusing to yield, instead found himself decapitated upon an altaromphalos of apollo thymbraios. later versions of the story suggested troilus was accidentally killed by achilles in an overardent lovers\\' embrace. in this version of the myth, achilles\\' death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege. ancient writers treated troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents. had troilus lived to adulthood, the first vatican mythographer claimed, troy would have been invincible however, the motif is older and found already in plautus\\' \"bacchides\". homer\\'s \"iliad\" is the most famous narrative of achilles\\' deeds in the trojan war. achilles\\' wrath  , \"mnis achills\" is the central theme of the poem. the first two lines of the \"iliad\" read the homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decadelong war, and does not narrate achilles\\' death. it begins with achilles\\' withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by agamemnon, the commander of the achaean forces. agamemnon has taken a woman named chryseis as his slave. her father chryses, a priest of apollo, begs agamemnon to return her to him. agamemnon refuses, and apollo sends a plague amongst the greeks. the prophet calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless achilles vows to protect him. achilles does so, and calchas declares that chryseis must be returned to her father. agamemnon consents, but then commands that achilles\\' battle prize briseis, the daughter of briseus, be brought to him to replace chryseis. angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away and, as he says later, because he loves briseis, with the urging of his mother thetis, achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other greek forces. at the same time, burning with rage over agamemnon\\'s theft, achilles prays to thetis to convince zeus to help the trojans gain ground in the war, so that he may regain his honour. as the battle turns against the greeks, thanks to the influence of zeus, nestor declares that the trojans are winning because agamemnon has angered achilles, and urges the king to appease the warrior. agamemnon agrees and sends odysseus and two other chieftains, ajax and phoenix, to achilles with the offer of the return of briseis and other gifts. achilles rejects all agamemnon offers him and simply urges the greeks to sail home as he was planning to do. the trojans, led by hector, subsequently push the greek army back toward the beaches and assault the greek ships. with the greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction, patroclus leads the myrmidons into battle, wearing achilles\\' armour, though achilles remains at his camp. patroclus succeeds in pushing the trojans back from the beaches, but is killed by hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of troy. after receiving the news of the death of patroclus from antilochus, the son of nestor, achilles grieves over his beloved companion\\'s death. his mother thetis comes to comfort the distraught achilles. she persuades hephaestus to make new armour for him, in place of the armour that patroclus had been wearing, which was taken by hector. the new armour includes the shield of achilles, described in great detail in the poem. enraged over the death of patroclus, achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field, killing many men in his rage but always seeking out hector. achilles even engages in battle with the river god scamander, who has become angry that achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed. the god tries to drown achilles but is stopped by hera and hephaestus. zeus himself takes note of achilles\\' rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of achilles can defy fate itself. finally, achilles finds his prey. achilles chases hector around the wall of troy three times before athena, in the form of hector\\'s favorite and dearest brother, deiphobus, persuades hector to stop running and fight achilles face to face. after hector realizes the trick, he knows the battle is inevitable. wanting to go down fighting, he charges at achilles with his only weapon, his sword, but misses. accepting his fate, hector begs achilles, not to spare his life, but to treat his body with respect after killing him. achilles tells hector it is hopeless to expect that of him, declaring that \"my rage, my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw  such agonies you have caused me\". achilles then kills hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot. after having a dream where patroclus begs achilles to hold his funeral, achilles hosts a series of funeral games in his honour. at the onset of his duel with hector, achilles is referred to as the brightest star in the sky, which comes on in the autumn, orion\\'s dog sirius a sign of evil. during the cremation of patroclus, he is compared to hesperus, the eveningwestern star venus, while the burning of the funeral pyre lasts until phosphorus, the morningeastern star also venus has set descended. with the assistance of the god hermes argeiphontes, hector\\'s father priam goes to achilles\\' tent to plead with achilles for the return of hector\\'s body so that he can be buried. achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral, lasting 9 days with a burial on the 10th in the tradition of niobe\\'s offspring. the poem ends with a description of hector\\'s funeral, with the doom of troy and achilles himself still to come. the \"aethiopis\" 7th century bc and a work named \"posthomerica\", composed by quintus of smyrna in the fourth century ad, relate further events from the trojan war. when penthesilea, queen of the amazons and daughter of ares, arrives in troy, priam hopes that she will defeat achilles. after his temporary truce with priam, achilles fights and kills the warrior queen, only to grieve over her death later. at first, he was so distracted by her beauty, he did not fight as intensely as usual. once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life, he refocused and killed her. following the death of patroclus, nestor\\'s son antilochus becomes achilles\\' closest companion. when memnon, son of the dawn goddess eos and king of ethiopia, slays antilochus, achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield, killing memnon. consequently, eos will not let the sun rise, until zeus persuades her. the fight between achilles and memnon over antilochus echoes that of achilles and hector over patroclus, except that memnon unlike hector was also the son of a goddess. many homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the \"iliad\"s description of the death of patroclus and achilles\\' reaction to it. the episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic \"aethiopis\", which was composed after the \"iliad\", possibly in the 7th century bc. the \"aethiopis\" is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors. the exact nature of achilles\\' relationship with patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times. in the \"iliad\", it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship. homer does not suggest that achilles and his close friend patroclus were lovers. although there is no direct evidence in the text of the \"iliad\" that achilles and patroclus were lovers, this theory was expressed by some later authors. commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. in 5thcentury bc athens, the intense bond was often viewed in light of the greek custom of \"paiderasteia\". in plato\\'s \"symposium\", the participants in a dialogue about love assume that achilles and patroclus were a couple phaedrus argues that achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and patroclus was the lover. but ancient greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual, and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women. many pairs of men throughout history have been compared to achilles and patroclus to imply a homosexual relationship. the death of achilles, even if considered solely as it occurred in the oldest sources, is a complex one, with many different versions. in the oldest one, the \"iliad\", and as predicted by hector with his dying breath, the hero\\'s death was brought about by paris with an arrow to the heel according to statius. in some versions, the god apollo guided paris\\' arrow. some retellings also state that achilles was scaling the gates of troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow. all of these versions deny paris any sort of valour, owing to the common conception that paris was a coward and not the man his brother hector was, and achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield. his bones were mingled with those of patroclus, and funeral games were held. he was represented in the \"aethiopis\" as living after his death in the island of leuke at the mouth of the river danube. another version of achilles\\' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the trojan princesses, polyxena. achilles asks priam for polyxena\\'s hand in marriage. priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world\\'s greatest warrior. but while priam is overseeing the private marriage of polyxena and achilles, paris, who would have to give up helen if achilles married his sister, hides in the bushes and shoots achilles with a divine arrow, killing him. in the \"odyssey\", agamemnon informs achilles of his pompous burial and the erection of his mound at the hellespont while they are receiving the dead suitors in hades. he claims they built a massive burial mound on the beach of ilion that could be seen by anyone approaching from the ocean. achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of patroclus. paris was later killed by philoctetes using the enormous bow of heracles. in book 11 of homer\\'s \"odyssey\", odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. one of these is achilles, who when greeted as \"blessed in life, blessed in death\", responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead. but achilles then asks odysseus of his son\\'s exploits in the trojan war, and when odysseus tells of neoptolemus\\' heroic actions, achilles is filled with satisfaction. this leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how achilles felt about the heroic life. according to some accounts, he had married medea in life, so that after both their deaths they were united in the elysian fields of hades as hera promised thetis in apollonius\\' \"argonautica\" 3rd century bc. achilles\\' armour was the object of a feud between odysseus and telamonian ajax ajax the greater. they competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after achilles to their trojan prisoners, who after considering both men\\'s presentations decided odysseus was more deserving of the armour. furious, ajax cursed odysseus, which earned him the ire of athena, who temporarily made ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep, thinking them his comrades. after a while, when athena lifted his madness and ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep, he was so ashamed that he committed suicide. odysseus eventually gave the armour to neoptolemus, the son of achilles. when odysseus encounters the shade of ajax much later in the house of hades \"odyssey\" 11.543566, ajax is still so angry about the outcome of the competition that he refuses to speak to odysseus. a relic claimed to be achilles\\' bronzeheaded spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of athena on the acropolis of phaselis, lycia, a port on the pamphylian gulf. the city was visited in 333 bc by alexander the great, who envisioned himself as the new achilles and carried the \"iliad\" with him, but his court biographers do not mention the spear however, it was shown in the time of pausanias in the 2nd century ad. numerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions. at some point in the war, achilles and ajax were playing a board game \"petteia\". they were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle. the trojans attacked and reached the heroes, who were saved only by an intervention of athena. the tomb of achilles, extant throughout antiquity in troad, was venerated by thessalians, but also by persian expeditionary forces, as well as by alexander the great and the roman emperor caracalla. achilles\\' cult was also to be found at other places, e. g. on the island of astypalaea in the sporades, in sparta which had a sanctuary, in elis and in achilles\\' homeland thessaly, as well as in the magna graecia cities of tarentum, locri and croton, accounting for an almost panhellenic cult to the hero. the cult of achilles is illustrated in the 500 bc polyxena sarcophagus, where the sacrifice of polixena near the tumulus of achilles is depicted. strabo 13.1.32 also suggested that such a cult of achilles existed in troad the spread and intensity of the hero\\'s veneration among the greeks that had settled on the northern coast of the pontus euxinus, today\\'s black sea, appears to have been remarkable. an archaic cult is attested for the milesian colony of olbia as well as for an island in the middle of the black sea, today identified with snake island ukrainian , \"zmiinyi\", near kiliya, ukraine. early dedicatory inscriptions from the greek colonies on the black sea graffiti and inscribed clay disks, these possibly being votive offerings, from olbia, the area of berezan island and the tauric chersonese attest the existence of a heroic cult of achilles from the sixth century bc onwards. the cult was still thriving in the third century ad, when dedicatory stelae from olbia refer to an \"achilles pontrchs\" , roughly \"lord of the sea,\" or \"of the pontus euxinus\", who was invoked as a protector of the city of olbia, venerated on par with olympian gods such as the local apollo prostates, hermes agoraeus, or poseidon. pliny the elder 2379 ad in his \"natural history\" mentions a \"port of the achi\" and an \"island of achilles\", famous for the tomb of that \"man\" portus achaeorum, insula achillis, tumulo eius viri clara, situated somewhat nearby olbia and the dnieperbug estuary furthermore, at 125roman miles from this island, he places a peninsula \"which stretches forth in the shape of a sword\" obliquely, called \"dromos achilleos\"  , \"achills drmos\" \"the racecourse of achilles\" and considered the place of the hero\\'s exercise or of games instituted by him. this last feature of pliny\\'s account is considered to be the iconic spit, called today \"tendra\" or \"kosa tendra\" and \"kosa djarilgatch\", situated between the mouth of the dnieper and karkinit bay, but which is hardly 125roman miles c. 185km away from the dnieperbug estuary, as pliny states. to the \"racecourse\" he gives a length of 80miles, c.120km, whereas the spit measures c.70km today. in the following chapter of his book, pliny refers to the same island as \"achillea\" and introduces two further names for it \"leuce\" or \"macaron\" from greek   \"island of the blest\". the \"present day\" measures, he gives at this point, seem to account for an identification of \"achillea\" or \"leuce\" with today\\'s snake island. pliny\\'s contemporary pomponius mela c. 43 ad tells that achilles was buried on an island named \"achillea\", situated between the borysthenes and the ister, adding to the geographical confusion. ruins of a square temple, measuring 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to achilles, were discovered by captain kritzikly in 1823 on snake island. a second exploration in 1840 showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple. a fifth century bc blackglazed lekythos inscription, found on the island in 1840, reads \"glaukos, son of poseidon, dedicated me to achilles, lord of leuke.\" in another inscription from the fifth or fourth century bc, a statue is dedicated to achilles, lord of leuke, by a citizen of olbia, while in a further dedication, the city of olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the island\\'s cult, again suggesting its quality as a place of a supraregional hero veneration. the heroic cult dedicated to achilles on \"leuce\" seems to go back to an account from the lost epic \"aethiopis\" according to which, after his untimely death, thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical   \"lek nsos\" \"white island\". already in the fifth century bc, pindar had mentioned a cult of achilles on a \"bright island\"  , \"phaenn nsos\" of the black sea, while in another of his works, pindar would retell the story of the immortalized achilles living on a geographically indefinite island of the blest together with other heroes such as his father peleus and cadmus. well known is the connection of these mythological fortunate isles  , \"makrn nsoi\" or the homeric elysium with the stream oceanus which according to greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world, which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the euxine with it. guy hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by alcaeus, speaking of \"achilles lord of scythia\" and the opposition of north and south, as evoked by achilles\\' fight against the aethiopian prince memnon, who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother eos after his death. the \"periplus of the euxine sea\" c. 130 ad gives the following details the greek geographer dionysius periegetes, who lived probably during the first century ad, wrote that the island was called \"leuce\" \"because the wild animals which live there are white. it is said that there, in leuce island, reside the souls of achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island this is how jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour\". similarly, others relate the island\\'s name to its white cliffs, snakes or birds dwelling there. pausanias has been told that the island is \"covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. in this island there is also achilles\\' temple and his statue\". leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. pausanias reports that the delphic pythia sent a lord of croton to be cured of a chest wound. ammianus marcellinus attributes the healing to waters \"aquae\" on the island. a number of important commercial port cities of the greek waters were dedicated to achilles. herodotus, pliny the elder and strabo reported on the existence of a town \"achlleion\" , built by settlers from mytilene in the sixth century bc, close to the hero\\'s presumed burial mound in the troad. later attestations point to an \"achlleion\" in messenia according to stephanus byzantinus and an \"achlleios\"  in laconia. nicolae densuianu recognized a connection to achilles in the names of aquileia and of the northern arm of the danube delta, called chilia presumably from an older \"achileii\", though his conclusion, that leuce had sovereign rights over the black sea, evokes modern rather than archaic sealaw. the kings of epirus claimed to be descended from achilles through his son, neoptolemus. alexander the great, son of the epirote princess olympias, could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor. he is said to have visited the tomb of achilles at achilleion while passing troy. in ad 216 the roman emperor caracalla, while on his way to war against parthia, emulated alexander by holding games around achilles\\' tumulus. the greek tragedian aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about achilles, given the title \"achilleis\" by modern scholars. the tragedies relate the deeds of achilles during the trojan war, including his defeat of hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by paris and guided by apollo punctures his heel. extant fragments of the \"achilleis\" and other aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play. the first part of the \"achilleis\" trilogy, \"the myrmidons\", focused on the relationship between achilles and chorus, who represent the achaean army and try to convince achilles to give up his quarrel with agamemnon only a few lines survive today. in plato\\'s \"symposium\", phaedrus points out that aeschylus portrayed achilles as the lover and patroclus as the beloved phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because achilles, being the younger and more beautiful of the two, was the beloved, who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him. the tragedian sophocles also wrote \"the lovers of achilles\", a play with achilles as the main character. only a few fragments survive. towards the end of the 5th century bc, a more negative view of achilles emerges in greek drama euripides refers to achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in \"hecuba\", \"electra\", and \"iphigenia in aulis\". the philosopher zeno of elea centred one of his paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between \"swiftfooted\" achilles and a tortoise, by which he attempted to show that achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start, and therefore that motion and change were impossible. as a student of the monist parmenides and a member of the eleatic school, zeno believed time and motion to be illusions. the romans, who traditionally traced their lineage to troy, took a highly negative view of achilles. virgil refers to achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men, while horace portrays achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children. other writers, such as catullus, propertius, and ovid, represent a second strand of disparagement, with an emphasis on achilles\\' erotic career. this strand continues in latin accounts of the trojan war by writers such as dictys cretensis and dares phrygius and in benot de saintemaure\\'s \"roman de troie\" and guido delle colonne\\'s \"historia destructionis troiae\", which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the matter of troy until the 17th century. achilles was described by the byzantine chronicler leo the deacon, not as hellene, but as scythian, while according to the byzantine author john malalas, his army was made up of a tribe previously known as myrmidons and later as bulgars. achilles has been frequently the subject of operas, ballets and related genres. in films achilles has been portrayed in the following films and television series in 1890, elisabeth of bavaria, empress of austria, had a summer palace built in corfu. the building is named the \"achilleion\", after achilles. its paintings and statuary depict scenes from the trojan war, with particular focus on achilles.'"
